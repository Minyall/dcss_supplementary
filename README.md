# Learning Materials for *Doing Computational Social Science*

This repo contains all of the learning materials accompanying [John McLevey (2021) *Doing Computational Social Science*, Sage, UK.](johnmclevey.com) It includes:

- **all datasets used in the book**:
  - a filtered and subsetted of the Version 11 [Varieties of Democracy](https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data/) data, released in 2021
  - the Canada Hansards, DATE to DATE
  - the British Hansards, DATE to DATE
  - a variety of social network datasets collected by the [SocioPatterns Team](http://www.sociopatterns.org)
  - a variety of social network datasets collected by the [Copenhagen Networks Study Team](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0325-x)
  - a dataset on global internet freedoms published by Freedom House
  - a collection of small datasets related to the 2020 American General Election
  - a subset of data from the European Values Survey
  - a subset of the Russian Trolls dataset collected by CITE and distributed by [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/)
- all **pre-trained (by us!) language models** used in the book and the questions / problem sets:
  - for the Canadian Hansards data
    - word2vec skip-gram, word2vec cbow, fastText, gloVe
      - all years, by decade, by party, by decade and party
  - for the British Hansards data
    - word2vec skip-gram, word2vec cbow, fastText, gloVe
      - all years, by decade, by party, by decade and party
  - for the full text of N journal articles, indexed by JSTOR, on democracies and autocracies
    - word2vec skip-gram, word2vec cbow, fastText
    - by decade
- questions and scaffolded problem sets accompanying every chapter of the book 
  - Note: these are what I use in my own classes at the University of Waterloo
  - Note: these materials will grow and evolve over time!
  - Note: these materials were developed collaboratively, many lead by my PhD students [Pierson Browne](https://github.com/pbrowne88) and [Tyler Crick](https://github.com/tcrick) in the context of my Winter and Spring 2021 offerings of INTEG 440 / SOC 440 (undergraduate) and INTEG 640 / SOC 719 (graduate) Computational Social Science classes at the University of Waterloo.  
- **supplementary chapter content and additional tutorials** for:
  - collecting data from social media platforms, including
    - Twitter
    - Reddit
  - web scraping with Selenium
  - data clustering
  - analytical Bayesian inference
- **practical advice from other data scientists and computational social scientists**, including:
  - Rochelle Terman
  - Alix Rule 
  - Jillian Anderson 
  - Pierson Browne
  - Tyler Crick
  - Sasha Graham
  - *with others on the way!*

These learning materials will continue to grow and evolve!
