This means that we have an as-of-yet untouched set of test data that we can use to make a final model selection. In this question, we're going to ask you to indicate which of the five classifiers we explored achieved the highest cross-validated accuracy. Then, in the next question, we'll ask you to report which of our candidate models achieves the highest accuracy. \n", "</div>\n", "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n", "Submit the name of the model that achieved the highest cross-validated accuracy.\n", "</div>"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["", "part_b_models =[\n", "    dtclass,\n", "    dtclass_pruned,\n", "    rforest,\n", "    gboost,\n", "    knn_model]\n", "\n", "# Write a few lines of code that will help you determine which model had the best cross-validated accuracy\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Problem 11:\n", "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">  \n", "After fitting each classifier to the full training data and assessing their performance in light of the held-out test data, report the name of the model that achieves the highest accuracy. \n", "</div>\n", "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n", "Perform the following steps, in order:\n", "<ol>\n", "    <li> Fit each of the five models on the entire training dataset\n", "    <li> Assess each of the fitted models' scores on the held-out test data\n", "    <li> Submit the name of the model that achieved the highest accuracy on the test data\n", "</ol>\n", "</div>"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["", "part_b_models =[\n", "    dtclass,\n", "    dtclass_pruned,\n", "    rforest,\n", "    gboost,\n", "    knn_model]\n", "\n", "# Write a few lines of code that will help you determine which model had the best accuracy on the test set\n"]}], "metadata": {"metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.8.5"}, "toc": {"base_numbering": 1, "nav_menu": {}, "number_sections": false, "sideBar": true, "skip_h1_title": false, "title_cell": "Table of Contents", "title_sidebar": "Contents", "toc_cell": false, "toc_position": {}, "toc_section_display": true, "toc_window_display": false}, "varInspector": {"cols": {"lenName": 16, "lenType": 16, "lenVar": 40}, "kernels_config": {"python": {"delete_cmd_postfix": "", "delete_cmd_prefix": "del ", "library": "var_list.py", "varRefreshCmd": "print(var_dic_list())"}, "r": {"delete_cmd_postfix": ") ", "delete_cmd_prefix": "rm(", "library": "var_list.r", "varRefreshCmd": "cat(var_dic_list()) "}}, "types_to_exclude": ["module", "function", "builtin_function_or_method", "instance", "_Feature"], "window_display": false}}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
