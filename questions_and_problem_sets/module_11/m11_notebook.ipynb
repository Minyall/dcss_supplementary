You give him his wet food every evening at 9:00pm sharp, and you always feed him in the kitchen. Solomon has a well-tuned internal clock, and can usually be found waiting (very impatiently) in the kitchen up to 10 minutes before scheduled mealtimes. Sometimes, however, Solomon will be elsewhere in the house -- blissfully asleep -- when 9:00pm rolls around. The moment he hears you pick up a tin of cat food, he'll immediately start scrambling towards the kitchen at breakneck speed. Amused by his behaviour, you have decided to describe the amount of time it takes for Solomon to appear in the kitchen after 9:00pm using a random variable $\\text{TUS}$ (which stands for \"Time Until Solomon\"). You measure this time by starting a stopwatch the moment you pick up a can of wet cat food (precisely at 9:00pm), and stop the stopwatch as soon as Solomon enters the kitchen. On most days, $\\text{TUS} =$ 0, because Solomon is already in the kitchen, but on other days, the amount of time it takes him depends on where in the house he's sleeping and how sleepy he is.
