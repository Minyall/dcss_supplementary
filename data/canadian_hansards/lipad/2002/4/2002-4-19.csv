4213436,ca.proc.d.2002-04-19.1998.1,2002-04-19,009b4f74-7547-4e5f-84a6-8f499d699a94,3518,"Hon. Paul DeVillers (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)",,Government Orders,Royal Assent Act,,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill S-34, an act respecting royal assent to bills passed by the Houses of Parliament.
The royal assent ceremony is based on the customs and conventions developed over previous centuries in the U.K. We rely on this ancient U.K. ceremony of royal assent for our own royal assent ceremony, which takes place in the Senate chamber.
I am sure that all members will agree that our royal assent ceremony is an important tradition of parliament. The ceremony lasts about 30 minutes and has taken place on 34 occasions in the course of the 36th and 37th parliaments. Each time a ceremony occurs, all MPs and senators must suspend their work on parliamentary business.
The royal assent ceremony requires the attendance of the Governor General or her deputy, a judge of the supreme court, who also have to suspend their work in order to attend the ceremony.
In recent decades, a number of issues related to royal assent have been identified by members of this House and the other place.
In 1983, the Senate launched discussions over alternatives to the procedure whereby the Governor General, in the Queen's name, signifies assent to bills passed by the Houses of Parliament.
In 1985, the standing rules and orders committee of the Senate issued its fourth report, recommending a change in the royal assent procedure. Also in 1985, in the House of Commons, the McGrath Committee Report on the Standing Orders recommended the simplification of royal assent.
In 1988, a bill on modernizing royal assent was introduced by the then leader of the government in the Senate. In 1988, the current leader of the opposition in the Senate introduced a similar bill.
The McGrath Committee and others have pointed to a number of issues regarding the royal assent ceremony. The ceremony interrupts the business of the House and the other place for approximately 30 minutes. This may have been appropriate in an earlier age, but in today's parliament, the need to stop all of the business of the House whenever royal assent is required no longer seems appropriate.
So, it is not surprising that other countries and provinces have acted to modernize the royal assent process by authorizing a written procedure for royal assent.
The traditional royal assent ceremony will also present members of this House with practical difficulties when renovations to the Centre Block begin, and continue over about eight years, with the House and Senate meeting in different buildings.
Particularly in the winter months, the maintenance of the traditional royal assent ceremony as the only way of signifying royal assent would be a burden on members of the House.
Members may be surprised to learn that Canada is the only Commonwealth country that still uses a traditional, but time consuming, royal assent ceremony on a regular basis as a sole procedure. Bill S-34 would aim to modernize the royal assent ceremony in keeping with what has been learned in other jurisdictions which share our parliamentary heritage.
In this regard members may be interested to know that the United Kingdom passed legislation in 1967 to allow royal assent by written declaration. In Australia the governor general's consent to bills is usually made known by a message to the president of the house of representatives and the speaker of the senate.
Other provinces also use the written process. In Ontario, in 1973, an all party agreement lead to the legislature waiving the formality of summoning the lieutenant governor to the chamber for royal assent. Except on special occasions the Ontario lieutenant governor now gives royal assent in her suite at Queen's Park. Quebec uses a written procedure which occurs in the offices of the lieutenant governor.
These practices by other Commonwealth countries and a number of provinces demonstrate that the written procedure of royal assent is purely a procedural matter. It does not alter the constitutional requirement for royal assent or affect the office and prerogatives of the governor general.
Section 55 of the Constitutional Act of 1867 requires that where a bill passed by the houses of parliament is presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent, the Governor General shall declare, according to his or her discretion, whether he or she assents to the bill. This remains unaffected.
The leader of the government in the Senate has declared the Governor General's consent to the consideration of Bill S-34. It is a long-standing parliamentary practice and a matter of politeness and civility to seek royal consent before introducing any bill which might affect royal prerogatives. In keeping with this practice the government sought and obtained, and has been declared in the chambers, royal consent to proceed with Bill S-34 even if technically the bill does not affect royal prerogative since it is procedural in nature.
Bill S-34 would provide a way of maintaining an important parliamentary tradition in authorizing a simpler way of handling royal assent. First, it would preserve the royal assent ceremony as an important tradition by requiring its use twice in each calendar year including for the first appropriation bill of each session. Second, it would permit royal assent by written declaration.
The bill's provisions are procedural and relate to the form of signifying royal assent. The Governor General, or his or her deputy, would continue to exercise the royal prerogative of assent either in the Senate chamber when royal assent is done by way of ceremony or by a written declaration reported to the Speakers of the two houses of parliament. Both procedures would respect the convention that all three constituent elements of parliament, the Crown, the Senate and the House of Commons would be involved in royal assent.
By allowing royal assent by written procedure we would be able to address the concerns of a modern parliament and at the same time make the traditional ceremony a special and more visible part of our parliamentary process.
I am proud that Bill S-34 is a non-partisan bill which draws on the work of many members on both sides of this House and the other place. It follows on the McGrath Committee's recommendations. And it enjoyed the support of the leadership of both sides of the other place.
Royal assent by written declaration will remove a significant interruption in the business of this House, while preserving the royal assent ceremony as an ongoing tradition of parliament.
Bill S-34 is consistent with the practice of Commonwealth countries and provinces who use this process. For these reasons I would invite all hon. members to support the passage of this bill.",Liberal,Simcoe North,Paul Devillers,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=009b4f74-7547-4e5f-84a6-8f499d699a94&Language=E&Section=ALL
4213437,ca.proc.d.2002-04-19.1998.2,2002-04-19,10ed8e96-0925-4e31-8bbb-c3da002050cf,3164,"Mr. John Reynolds (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance)",,Government Orders,Royal Assent Act,,"Mr. Speaker, I thank the government side. We will be supporting the bill wholeheartedly.
The bill will provide an alternative to the royal assent procedure currently used in the Canadian parliament so that royal assent will be signified by a written declaration similar to that used in Australia and the United Kingdom for many years. It will preserve at least one traditional royal assent ceremony per year. These procedures will take place during the parliamentary session in which both Houses pass the bill.
The first appropriation bill presented for assent in any session, however, will require a formal assent ceremony. The procedure for appropriation bills is slightly different in that the Speaker of the House of Commons presents them as a reminder that it is the House that grants aids and supplies and has the pre-eminent role in voting supply. The requirement that the first appropriation bill in a session be given royal assent in the traditional form will also assure the occasional holding of a formal ceremony.
The bill also provides that royal assent be signified in a traditional ceremony on at least one occasion in each calendar year. The bill proposes that the Speaker or person acting as the Speaker notify both the Senate and the House of Commons of a written declaration of royal assent. The bill also provides that where royal assent was signified by written declaration, the date of assent would be the day on which the declaration was reported in both chambers. This would be particularly relevant to bills that came into force upon royal assent or on a day related to the date of royal assent.
Most countries with a Westminster style of parliament have abandoned the royal assent ceremony. Canada appears to be unique among Commonwealth countries in retaining the procedure. The question of reforming the royal assent process in the Canadian parliament has arisen on a number of occasions in recent years. Throughout the eighties and nineties, committees of the House and the Senate studying parliamentary reform have all recommended that the royal assent ceremony be replaced with a written message and that the traditional practice be maintained for occasional and special uses. Bills to implement this recommendation have been drafted and have ground slowly through other parliaments, but were never given the priority to reach fruition. Perhaps it is the government's thin agenda that will finally give this new procedure life.
This change improves efficiency of the House and maintains the traditional ceremony when such a ceremony is desirable. The official opposition, as I have said, supports the bill and the official opposition would like to see more parliamentary reform, particularly in the area of private members' business. Over 70% of our members polled on this issue felt that reform was needed. Two hundred and thirty-five bills have been introduced by MPs from all political parties. None have made it past third reading. Only two House private members' bills have made it to a vote at second reading, less than 1%. The two bills that did make it into committee stage from the 36th parliament were killed in committee by the Liberal majority on those committees.
Liberals avoid voting on controversial issues by not deeming them votable. Senate private bills have been successful. The only three bills that have received royal assent have come from the Senate. They are: Bill S-10, parliamentary poet laureate; Bill S-14, Sir John A. Macdonald and Wilfrid Laurier Day; and Bill S-22, national horse of Canada. Of the 481 motions introduced, only 5 have been adopted, just over 1%.
We have had over 150 hours of debate in the House during this parliament for consideration of private members' business. If we consider that the budget of the House is $300 million, at a 1,000 hours per year that is $300,000 per hour. If we apply that to the amount of time used up by private members' business, we get $45 million of House time used to no avail.
The procedure and House affairs committee took on the task of reforming private members' business. It began in the fall of 2001 and had until April 2002 to come to some sort of arrangement to make all items votable. It decided in December 2001 that it could not do anything about it. The truth is that the government did not want to do anything about it.
Recently a rare event occurred. The Liberal majority on the procedure and House affairs committee actually allowed a bill to enjoy votable status, the bill of the member for Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca to decriminalize the use and possession of marijuana. However, as you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the government moved a poison pill amendment and had the bill withdrawn. The Prime Minister giveth and he taketh away.
The backbench should stand up to the Prime Minister and show him who is boss. It is the Prime Minister who is accountable to the House, not the other way around. If there were a few stray votes here and there, the Prime Minister might pay attention and he might even listen. He might even learn to respect the backbench, the House and democracy.
That being said, we support the bill. We wish the government well in bringing forth more reforms in the House of Commons, which members of the House from all sides would be quite happy to support.",Canadian Alliance,West Vancouver--Sunshine Coast,John Reynolds,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=10ed8e96-0925-4e31-8bbb-c3da002050cf&Language=E&Section=ALL

As some of my colleagues explained, the purpose of this bill is to change the way we proceed, in particular through the introduction of a written declaration instead of what I would describe as the traditional parade we now have.
First, I want to say that we unreservedly agree with this legislation, which should have been introduced long ago. It is also surprising that it is coming from the other chamber instead of this one. We think that a genuine modernization of our institutions must be undertaken. Not only there must be a debate about the way the assent is given, in this case through a written declaration, but also a larger debate should be launched in this House about the way, for example, we proceed with voting. Would it be possible, for example, to consider holding a debate on what is called electronic voting? Would it not be worthwhile to hold a debate on the way our institutions work in order to speed up the process and make it more effective and efficient?
Today we are going at it with a timid step, one that we approve, of course, but we also want this debate to go further, to improve the effectiveness of parliament.
Need I remind the House that this bill comes from the other place. While the elected representatives of the people should be the ones involved in modernizing Canadian institutions, this piece of legislation is coming from the Senate. Ironically, the government has refused for years to make official something that should have been made so years ago.
Concerning Bill S-34, an act respecting royal assent to bills passed by the Housesof Parliament, let me say to the House that our party will support the bill, as I said earlier, since its intent is to modernize parliament, something we have been wishing for for a long time. This is the kind of debate young parliamentarians would like. We believe that we can speed up the proceedings of parliament through very simple measures that would make this institution more efficient.
We think this bill from the other house is a legitimate one. Its intent is to modernize the royal assent procedure by enabling royal assent to be signifiedby written declaration, instead of the traditional parade we now have for each royal assent ceremony.
The government member has reminded us that this procedure was changed a long time ago in Quebec. Back in 1969, Quebec opted for the written declaration procedure for the approval of bills. It is somewhat strange that we had to wait until 2002 to do the same thing, when other institutions and modern parliaments in America decided long ago to have this procedure, which should be considered normal, official, acceptable and legitimate.
In Quebec, I would point out, royal assent has been given through what could be called a summary process since 1969. More than 30 years ago, Quebec decided, through its institution, that it would use a written declaration process. On February 27, 1969, the National Assembly adopted the second report of its standing orders review committee. This committee recommended that bills be given assent in the office of the lieutenant-governor. The report was adopted that same day. It was a step towards the modernization of parliament.
There are many other fundamental reforms the government should implement. At the very least, the government should allow private members' business introduced by members on this side not only to be debated in the House, but also to be made votable. Such a move would be the first step in the modernization of parliament. Modernization is not a hollow concept, it is a concept that can increase the efficiency of our institutions.
The House should discuss certain matters, such as the modernization of the Senate, up to and including its abolition, as well as the modernization of the traditional voting process, up to and including electronic voting.
Obviously those substantive debates, by which Canada and this institution will move in the direction of true modernization, are far from the timid bill before us. This legislation is only designed to provide a written declaration as an alternative procedure for signifying royal assent, thereby doing away with the parade. While modern legislatures in America have decided to modernize 30 years ago, we can see through this debate that, compared to initiatives taken by other legislatures here in America, and I take as an example the National Assembly of Quebec, our institution is lagging behind.
Besides, need I remind the House that during what has been called the quiet revolution in Quebec, the government of Quebec carried out an extensive reform of parliamentary institutions. As a matter of fact, on November 29, 1968, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec passed a bill abolishing the legislative council, the equivalent of the other place in this parliament.
On December 12 of the same year, the legislative council undertook consideration of the bill providing for its abolition.
The council gave speedy passage to the bill. On December 18, 1968, the act abolishing the legislative council received assent. Under this legislation, there is now only one chamber, the National Assembly, with men and women democratically elected by the people.",Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois,Rosemont--Petite-Patrie,Bernard Bigras,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b423ba61-95aa-4b51-8b1c-1543eac4f01f&Language=E&Section=ALL

This bill came into force in 1968. This legislation, which basically abolished the legislative council, should also lead us to this real debate which we must have sooner or later in this House. We must not only change the procedure of royal proclamation in order to eliminate the so-called parade through a written declaration, but we must also debate what role of the Senate should really play.
Quebec was not afraid to start the Quiet Revolution and the Parliament of Canada, as an institution, ought not to fear a democratic debate that will lead eventually to a decision. That decision may not be a consensus, but it will change the way things are done.
We know that the Canadian Alliance wants to reform the Senate, while we want to abolish it. The government seems to want to keep it the way it is, and we all know why. We know that it is where they can make partisan appointments.
All that we can hope for, basically, is to make a few changes which will become official but which will not lead to any real and thorough debates on the role of that other chamber of this institution.
Need I remind hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois has done quite a lot in this connection. Back in 1996, my colleague from Kamouraska--RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup--TÃ©miscouata--Les Basques launched a debate on abolition of the Senate. On November 6, 1996, my colleague said the following: âwhile programs are being reviewed everywhere,â âas we are today doing with Bill S-34ââand expenses are being cut, the government has missed a great opportunity to make an important symbolic gesture that would have proven its good faith, its desire to give the elected representatives of the people their full voice and legitimacy.â
With this, my colleague launched a debate that could well have been part of the one we are having today on Bill S-34. We know that the budget directly allocated to the Senate totals $43 million , and that the other chamber constitutes a key element in the efficiency and effectiveness of our parliamentary institutions. This is, I would remind hon. members, a chamber that is not answerable to the people, is not elected, and very often serves as a political reward to friends of the government.
The government could have taken the initiative of holding this worthwhile debate, as my colleague form the Canadian Alliance and leader of the opposition has just said, in order to enable members so desiring to introduce bills and motions, which would not only be debated but also be made votable. Once these motions and bills are deemed votable, the government should not resort to dilatory motions to prevent the House from debating these fundamental issues and voting on them.
This should allow us to embark on the real modernization we want, which should not be limited simply to the abolition of the traditional parade leading to royal assent. It should lead to a real review of our institution in order to make it more effective and to give more powers to parliamentarians, regardless of which side of the House they sit on, so that decisions can also be made more efficiently.
At the dawn of the 21st century, it is hard to see how the government can consider the Senate to be truly legitimate in any way. Could the government not simply take a step toward modernizing the Senate, something it has always refused to do? It refuses to do so because it wants it to become a patronage den. It refuses because the Senate works for its benefit, in terms of friendships and decisions.
We must reflect on the role of the Senate, because it is delaying a number of bills. It duplicates the work being done by the house and, in the end, it only symbolic. This is something we came to understand in Quebec 30 years ago, when we abolished the legislative council.
Given that this parade is purely symbolic, why is it that the Senate, which is also symbolic, does not also deserve to be abolished, as we are about to do with respect to royal assent with Bill S-34?
In closing, we support Bill S-34, to abolish this parade and have royal assent signified by written declaration. We believe that this institution must be more effective. We believe that this bill constitutes a first step, a small one, granted, toward modernizing our institutions.
For 30 years now in Quebec, this type of measure has been proven to speed up the debate process, and ultimately, the decision making process, thereby making them both more effective.",Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois,Rosemont--Petite-Patrie,Bernard Bigras,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b423ba61-95aa-4b51-8b1c-1543eac4f01f&Language=E&Section=ALL

I also wish to state that our House leader, the member for Winnipeg--Transcona, was an integral part of the committee that brought these changes forward. We believe that his leadership on this file has assisted in many ways in getting this to the forefront of where we are today.
The question of reforming the royal assent process in the Canadian parliament has risen on a number of occasions in recent years, notably in the report of the McGrath committee of 1985. Many significant reforms to the House came out of this report. In fact our House leader, again the member for Winnipeg--Transcona, was a member of the committee which introduced, among other things, the ability to have some private members' businesses votable, maybe not as many as I personally would like but it was a start.
This is what happens when we have a very effective parliamentarian in the House of Commons from the New Democratic Party to bring these great issues forward to all levels of government and all other parties.
Bill S-34 will continue to remind us how laws are passed in Canada, how the House, the Senate and the Governor General each play a unique role in bringing legislation forward, and of the ability for us as members of parliament to bring forward issues or amendments on various pieces of legislation and watch that legislation flow through the process in a parliamentary reform.
I also want to mention the fact that although this is a very important aspect of changes to our House of Commons in terms of forming more of a simple procedure in this regard, it maintains the traditions that we hold so strongly in our parliamentary tradition. It is worth noting that the majority of members of parliament here would support this initiative.

It is a bill that provides an alternative procedure for the granting of royal assent to legislation while at the same time maintaining elements of the present system.
Bill S-34 did originate in the other place with the subject matter that other members have touched on and harkens back to the days of the McGrath committee of the mid-1980s. The origins however are somewhat betrayed given the snail's pace with which the government has embraced even the mildest form of parliamentary reform.
Be that as it may, this form of modernization, coming some 20 years late, should lead some members of parliament at least to rejoice in its small ray of light. Will it in fact be a symbol of change or merely a few crumbs from the PMO? I fear the latter.
When we look at the history of the legislation, it goes back to 1988 when the then leader of the Conservative government in the Senate, senator Lowell Murray, introduced a bill to modernize royal assent. The current leader of the Conservative Party in the Senate, Senator Lynch-Staunton, then took up the mantle in 1998 by introducing a similar bill known as Bill S-19. That bill had several incarnations and Senator Lynch-Staunton of the other place, a very clear thinking and hardworking senator, persevered and continued to bring this legislation back to the floor of the Senate.
What we have here in the final bill practically mirrors Senator Lynch-Staunton's good work and provides an alternative procedure for the granting of royal assent.
The practice we have seen time and time again in both this place and the other place where the Liberals would take an idea, denounce it when in opposition, then embrace it and call it their own is being followed again.
Many have argued over the years that there has been a need for an alternative to the practices which, some might argue, are time consuming, archaic and interrupt the flow of parliament. Some of the practical arguments that have been made to bolster and bring about this change talk about the practical problems. The ceremony itself has sadly fallen into some disrepute in that it is very rarely attended in any great numbers by members of this Chamber. The royal assent practice is usually delivered by a supreme court judge acting as deputy governor general. The judges themselves have raised concerns about the time constraints and the time consuming elements of their attendance.
Looking again at very practical concerns, we know there are times when the two Chambers are not sitting simultaneously, which might technically hold up or hold back certain legislation.
The royal assent ceremony is time consuming. There is also reference to the planned renovations to the House of Commons as being something that would create further challenges with respect to the practice of royal assent.
Numerous studies, including the McGrath commission, did look at ways to reform parliament and this is but one of those pearls of wisdom.
Given that the royal assent is held with such frequency, it is a ceremony as referenced that sometimes receives very little attention yet it has obvious longstanding, traditional origins with respect to the granting of the passage of bills.
There are some who take umbrage and exception to these practices, including members of the Bloc and in many ways members of the Alliance, nee the Reform Party, who were very much against the Senate until it got a senator of its own. Like some of the other practices, Alliance members have been noticeably kinder to the other places, much like their embrace of things like Stornoway, pensions and other parliamentary privileges.
With respect to the substance of the bill, the obvious reason to allow for written consents, as the bill now does, is that there are instances when the bill might be before this House while the Senate is in recess or vice versa. Often the Commons is required to technically resume sitting for the sole purposes of granting royal assent.
While I certainly respect the views of those, such as the Monarchist League of Canada, that has a branch in my riding in Nova Scotia in Pictou county, who argue that the traditional royal assent ceremony is very important, constitutionally and symbolically, it must be noted that Canada is the last commonwealth country to require royal assent be given in the presence of both Houses. We are somewhat languishing behind in the commonwealth country family in that regard.
Elsewhere in the commonwealth, including Australia, New Zealand and other countries, royal assent is usually delivered in writing. In fact this is what the bill will enable our parliament to do.
To further put to rest concerns that Bill S-34 does not require that the traditional ceremony be used, the bill allows at least once a year and for the first appropriation bill of the session, although this bill would not be invalid simply because the government failed to use the traditional ceremony within a calendar year, for the ceremony to occur at the will and whim of parliament.
The Progressive Conservative Party very much supports Bill S-34 as a snail pace, a gradual baby step forward in terms of parliamentary reform. Previous members did reference the fact that we bore witness to yet another erosion of parliamentary practice, which I think very much impinges upon the members of parliament, the members of the opposition in particular, to bring forward private and useful initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life and the workings of parliament. Two days ago we saw the government embark upon an unprecedented step of essentially killing a private member's bill, which again is a dark day for parliament.
Sadly, this incident resulted in another outburst which challenged some of the respect and goodwill that should exist around this place. Certainly the level of frustration continues to grow, not only among members of the opposition. I strongly suspect that this sentiment is shared by many of the backbench on the government side who feel these erosions of the last bastions that parliamentarians have to bring forward private initiatives and ideas is being cast aside.
Bill S-34 is one that at least symbolically shows that this place can change, modernize, adapt and become more relevant in the eyes of Canadians and in the eyes of those who participate in what sometimes seems like a circus.
The Conservative Party also wants to congratulate our colleagues in the Senate, Senator Murray and Senator Lynch-Staunton, for taking leadership on issues such as this over the years. We again commend the members of the other place for ensuring that there is an efficient use of parliamentary time and parliamentary privileges that at the same time respect the historic traditions of all who have graced these halls and all who have been fortunate enough to come to this place to represent Canadians nationwide.",Progressive Conservative,Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough,Peter MacKay,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=46dccbed-4370-40f0-975f-d08fe1688aa2&Language=E&Section=ALL

This legislation provides Canadian securities and derivative clearing houses with legal protection, similar to those in place in the United States and other G-7 countries, in the event that one of the members becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy. Before discussing the bill, I would like to take a few minutes to provide some background which will put these changes into context.
These amendments are in line with the commitment the government made in the Speech from the Throne in January 2001 to keep Canadian laws and regulations competitive. Bill S-40 helps to meet this commitment. I want to remind the House of the government's long term plan to build a strong economy, a plan that also includes an internationally competitive economy. An efficient and strong financial sector is a key requirement for achieving a strong economy.
With the major contributions to job creation, export growth and tax revenues, Canada's financial sector is vital to the country's economic well-being. Central to a healthy financial sector is the Canadian securities and derivatives industry, its exchanges and their clearing houses.
The Canadian securities derivatives industry is a key player in Canada's financial system. Its contribution is significant. The industry provides a mechanism for raising capital and hedging financial risks through derivative contracts. It is a highly competitive industry.
For example, in recent years the number of security firms in Canada has increased from 170 in 1995 to almost 200 today. These firms are important players in Canada's securities and derivative clearing houses. The size of the industry is significant. Gross revenues in 2001 were $10 billion. In 1999 security firms assisted corporations raising $39 billion in debt and $21 billion in equity. Security firms also assisted provincial governments in raising $25 billion in debt and participated in the sale of $50 billion of Government of Canada bonds.
The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange trades over $2 million agricultural futures and options contracts per year worth about $13.5 billion. Participants trading in the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange include international grain trading companies, brokerage firms, primary and terminal elevator companies, local floor traders, financial institutions and farmers.
The bill we are debating today focuses on Canada's security derivative clearing houses, which are among the most efficient in the world. These organizations enable consumers and businesses to settle securities and derivative transactions in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. They accomplish this by acting as a central counter party to securities and derivative trades.
In Canada, the clearing and settlement of securities derivative trades is conducted through three clearing houses. The Canadian Depository for Securities, CDS, is Canada's national securities depository clearing and settlement centre. It handles about $57 million security trades each year for banks, brokers, trust companies and other industry members. The CDS is also a custodian of securities for federally incorporated institutions like banks, trust and loan companies, insurance companies and pension funds.
The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, CDCC, is the clearing house for derivative contracts traded on the Bourse de Montreal.
The third organization, the WCE Clearing Corporation, WCECC, is the clearing house for derivative contracts relating to agricultural commodities traded on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, the WCE. The WCECC has an arrangement with CDCC to provide certain clearing and settlement services for the WCECC.
These three clearing houses clear and settle trades carried out on the four major exchanges in Canada. Securities and derivative exchanges underwent a major realignment in 1999 to enable them to better compete with exchanges around the world and new electronic entrants to the Canadian market. Each exchange now specializes in a certain area.
The Toronto Stock Exchange is the sole market for senior equities. Its listed companies represent a broad range of businesses from across Canada, the Untied States and other countries.
The Canadian Venture Exchange, CDNX, in Calgary, which was created through a merger of the Alberta and Vancouver stock exchanges, is the major market for junior equities. The Canadian Venture Exchange recently has been renamed the TSX Venture Exchange. Its companies are particularly active in the mining, oil and gas manufacturing and technology sectors.
The Bourse de MontrÃ©al is responsible for all non-commodities derivatives trading and other clearing services to its corporation, the CDCC. Transactions involving agricultural commodity derivatives take place on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, which is Canada's only agricultural futures and options exchange. Future contracts traded at the WCE include canola, canola meal, flaxseed, domestic feed wheat, western barley and field peas.
The centralized clearing and settlement services provided by clearing houses for securities and derivative markets are important in three aspects.
First, securities and derivatives markets are critical in providing opportunities to raise capital for investment and hedging financial risks.
Second, securities and derivatives markets rely upon the efficient and timely clearing and settlement of transactions through clearing houses.
Third, these clearing houses take measures to reduce risk and cost and settlement of securities and derivatives transactions.
Any factors that negatively affect the operation of these clearing houses and increase their costs will impact on the securities derivatives markets by reducing their efficiency and increasing trade costs. A potential cost to these clearing houses--",Liberal,Oak Ridges,Bryon Wilfert,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=270eed77-cf5d-4c14-9ee8-2e8ad61fba99&Language=E&Section=ALL

As Canadians we condemn all acts of terrorism and all acts of violence. Neither serves the interest of peace.

We must not allow, nor can we accept, the spilling of innocent blood in the name of so-called justice.
However we must not allow our society to be polarized and politicized by events which, however painful to some, cannot obscure our country's desire to see a political settlement that provides for secure borders for Israel, recognition of the Jewish state by the Arab world, and the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in harmony with its neighbours.
I am saddened and disturbed to see Canadians young and old shouting slogans and demanding retribution. This is not the Canadian way. Nor does it serve the cause of peace. Benedict Spinoza said of peace:

Peace is not an absence of war; it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.

Fourteen year old children are too young to drive. They are too young to consume alcohol, smoke or even vote. Yet the justice minister irresponsibly agrees to not change the laws that allow our 14 year olds to consent to sexual relations.
The sexual exploitation of our nation's children by adults should one of the government's top priorities. At the very least, the minister should increase the legal age of consent to 16. This would in part help protect our children from sexual exploitation.
A 1999 department of justice paper states that the present age of consent is too low to provide effective protection for children from sexual exploitation by adults. Additionally, last year both the provincial justice ministers and the Canadian Police Association passed resolutions calling on the federal government to raise the age of consent for sexual activity to at least 16 years of age.

Phase II of the national strategy, launched in June 1998 at $32 million per year, built on the recommendations and the four years of consultation and policy work of the former National Crime Prevention Council. The objectives of the national strategy are:
(a) to promote the integrated action of key governmental and non-governmental partners to reduce crime and victimization;
(b) to assist communities in developing and implementing community-based solutions to problems that contribute to crime and victimization, particularly as they affect children, youth, women, and Aboriginal people; and
(c) to increase public awareness of, and support for, effective approaches to crime prevention.
In approving resources for phase II of the national strategy, the Treasury Board Secretariat required that a mid-term evaluation be completed by March 2001 and a summative evaluation be completed by November 2002. The mid-term evaluation focused on the organizational structures that have been built in support of the national strategy and made a number of recommendations for improvement. The upcoming summative evaluation will focus more on the results that are attributable to the work of the National Crime Prevention Centre, NCPC, in its support of the national strategy. In short, the evaluation will assess the extent to which the NCPC has moved toward the achievement of its objectives.
In the summer of 2000, a mid-term process evaluation of phase II of the national strategy was conducted to determine whether the design and implementation of the national strategy would support the attainment of its objectives and its five long term impacts. Key stakeholders and the mid-term process evaluation of phase II identified the need for a gradual, strategic expansion component to the national strategy. The findings of the evaluation specifically stressed the need for improvement in the following five areas if the national strategy is to be successful in reaching high risk groups and vulnerable communities: more comprehensive support structure; stronger policy, research and evaluation capacity; expanded and strategic use of partnerships; greater focus on sustainability; and effective public education and promotion.
As a result of recommendations made in the mid-term evaluation, the NCPC underwent an organizational review during the summer of 2001.
All projects funded under the crime prevention investment fund, one of the strategyâs five funding programs, undergo rigorous, third party evaluations. Through this research and development crime prevention fund, we will learn what is promising, what works, what does not and in what context. Evaluators are required to conduct process evaluations, outcome evaluations and collect costing data to be used by the NCPC to carry out a benefit-cost analysis of selected crime prevention projects. It should be noted that virtually all of the third-party evaluations are still on-going today as they typically last four years in duration; notwithstanding, the NCPC has received promising interim results for many of the project evaluations.
In June 2000 a study entitled an Evaluation of Crime Prevention Community Mobilization Projects in Selected Communities Across Canada was completed. Although the sample size of projects reviewed and analyzed was small and the focus of the study was on process evaluation, several key findings emerged. It was found that project evaluations tended to report on activities, client satisfaction with these activities, e.g., services, workshops, or communication information, and future program or service needs. In some regions, such as Nova Scotia, representatives of the Department of Justice realized that community groups varied in their level of expertise in carrying out evaluations and produced a hand-out providing guidance on how to identify project outcomes, in particular impacts on client groups and partnerships established. To attempt to address these and other issues associated with evaluation, the research and evaluation section of the NCPC will be releasing a publication this spring pertaining to the development of logic models and theories of change. It is hoped that this document will assist community groups and organizations in developing their projects and logically linking up proposed crime prevention activities to anticipated short, intermediate and long term outcomes.
Crime prevention through social development, CPSD, is a community based, long term approach to preventing crime and victimization that recognizes the complex social, economic and cultural processes that contribute to crime and victimization. Because CPSD focuses on the social development end of the crime prevention equation, it can take time, i.e. years, for the crime prevention benefits to accrue. Notwithstanding, we are very confident that projects and interventions, which have resulted in measurable reductions in levels of crime and victimization and in improvements to community safety, can be identified.
Many problems of crime and victimization are common worldwide. As a result, it should be noted that Canada can also learn from the promising, model and best practices of other countries. Scientific evidence to date already shows that some prevention programs work, some do not, some are promising, and some have not been tested adequately. NCPC works hard to keep abreast of this information and to subsequently share what is learned for the purpose of guiding our policy frameworks and project funding decisions.",Liberal,Northumberland,Paul MacKlin,

As a central counter party, securities and derivatives clearing houses take measures to reduce this risk. For example, members are required to post collateral and to net their payment and delivery obligations with the clearing house.
By way of explanation netting is a way to significantly reduce the net payment and delivery obligations of members of the clearing house, in some cases by tenfold. If, for example, a member of a clearing house buys a security for $1,000 and sells another for $900, the member's net obligation to the clearing house is $100.
Collateral, as hon. members know, is an asset that is posted, in this case with securities and derivatives clearing house, to partially offset members' obligations to the clearing house in case they cannot fulfil their obligation. Collateral is usually provided in the form of a cash deposit or the transfer or pledge of a security.
Like many of its counterparts in other countries, the Canadian securities and derivatives industry has been faced with the challenges of globalization, rapid technological change and consolidation.
Proximity to the United States and relatively low barriers to entry for foreign securities dealers, free movement of capital and an increasingly North American focus of many large Canadian corporations have made the securities and derivatives markets be more competitive. As a response, larger Canadian securities firms have been improving their quality to service clients on a North American basis. Canadian exchanges have also been facing this intensifying competitive environment.
Issuers of capital are increasingly able to access global markets, bypassing local markets and intermediaries. A growing number of Canadian firms are choosing to list their stock on U.S. exchanges. In addition, U.S. derivatives exchanges offer derivatives on Canadian indexes, commodities and companies.
It is imperative then that the Canadian securities and derivatives industry be able to compete with other countries, particularly with the United States where a significant portion of Canadian securities and derivatives trading occurs.
The industry needs a competitive legal regime that lowers settlement risks and the associated costs to these clearing houses. Such a change will make these clearing houses in Canada more efficient and competitive with the United States and other G-7 countries and help to keep trading activity here at home.
Without these changes, more securities and derivatives trading will occur outside of Canada, primarily in the United States where bankruptcy and insolvency legislation generally exempts securities and derivatives clearing organizations from court ordered stays and allows them to net the obligations of members and realize their members' collateral.
Recent changes in Europe also reaffirm the importance of keeping our industry competitive.
The settlement finality directive which came into force in 1998 established a legal framework for payment and securities settlement systems in the European Union. EU member states must ensure that securities settlement systems can net obligations and that the netting is legally enforceable and binding on third parties in the event of insolvency. The directive also provides for collateral to be realized in a timely manner in any wind-up procedure.
Laws in Canada do not fully protect netting agreements and collateral posted with securities and derivatives clearing houses to the same extent.
Stakeholders in Canada have raised concerns that current federal legislation does not prevent court imposed stays from securities and derivatives clearing houses realizing collateral in the event of their members becoming bankrupt or insolvent.
The Bourse de MontrÃ©al, on behalf of the CDCC, along with the WCE Clearing Corporation and the Canadian Depository for Securities have all requested that the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act be amended to cover securities and derivatives clearing houses. They are concerned that Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws add to the cost of their clearing house operations and to their members by increasing the costs related to the risk of a failure of one of their members.
It is difficult to attract large international dealers and trades to Canada if these Canadian clearing houses face higher costs because they cannot enforce their netting and collateral agreements with members in the event of the insolvency of one or more members.
Given how our competitors function, it is imperative that changes be made to ensure that Canadian securities and derivatives clearing houses can compete with those in the United States and in Europe.
Bill S-40 addresses these issues. The amendments in Bill S-40 will make Canadian securities and derivatives clearing houses more efficient and competitive with the United States and the other G-7 countries, allow them to lower their costs and help to keep trading activity in Canada. This is accomplished by amending the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act to include legal protections for securities and derivatives clearing houses of their netting agreements and collateral posted by their members.
These amendments protect netting agreements and prevent stays imposed by a court on the ability of securities and derivatives clearing houses to realize collateral in case of bankruptcy or insolvency of one of their members.
Hon. members should bear in mind that the protections being sought through this bill are over federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws. These legal protections will allow Canadian securities and derivatives clearing houses to lower their settlement risks and settlement costs, thereby making them more efficient and competitive with the United States and other G-7 countries.
Before closing I want to draw the attention of hon. members to recent recommendations made by the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS, to which the amendments of the bill adhere.
The BIS is an important forum for international monetary and financial co-operation between central bankers and other regulators and supervisors. Its work has contributed to the setting of standards, codes and best practices that are deemed essential for strengthening the financial architecture worldwide.
Last November the BIS made recommendations about securities settlement systems, including securities clearing houses. These recommendations support a well-founded legal basis for securities settlement systems so that rules and procedures can be enforced with a high degree of certainty. In particular, it favours the enforceability of netting arrangements and the ability to realize assets pledged as collateral.
As I mentioned earlier, securities and derivatives clearing houses are important to the efficient operation of our financial markets.
First, securities and derivatives markets are critical in providing opportunities to raise capital for investments and hedging financial risks.
Second, securities and derivatives clearing houses take measures to reduce settlement risks and associated costs through netting and requiring members to post collateral.
Third, it is important that the measures taken by these clearing houses to reduce risks are supported by a sound and competitive legal regime.
In considering the bill, I urge hon. members to keep these three additional points in mind: First, that these amendments are in keeping with recommendations by the Bank for International Settlements regarding securities settlement systems; second, that they are supported in Canada by financial sector participants and their associations, by provincial governments and by the insolvency community; and third, that they help meet a throne speech commitment to keep Canadian laws competitive.
It is essential that Canada's financial sector remains strong and efficient. The amendments in Bill S-40 will help to ensure this. A competitive legal regime will help keep securities and derivatives trading in Canada and assist the industry in attracting international deals and brokers here.
For those reasons, I urge hon. members to pass the legislation without delay.",Liberal,Oak Ridges,Bryon Wilfert,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=270eed77-cf5d-4c14-9ee8-2e8ad61fba99&Language=E&Section=ALL

I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill S-40 for the simple reason that the bill's purpose is to modernize the securities sector. The Montreal Stock Exchange, which recently became the only derivatives clearing house in North America, will therefore be able to benefit from this bill. In fact, all key players at the Montreal Stock Exchange worked very hard to move this bill forward and ensure that its wording would satisfy the objectives of both the Montreal Stock Exchange and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation.
First, I wish to congratulate Luc Bertrand, president of the Montreal Stock Exchange, Giovanni Giarrusso, first vice-president and general manager of institutional affairs, and Michel Favreau, first vice-president and chief of compensation. I wish to commend them for their excellent work, for their contribution to the debate and for the necessary changes incorporated in Bill S-40 with respect to the proper conduct of operations at the Montreal Stock Exchange and the clearing corporation.
As I mentioned, the Montreal Exchange is the only derivatives market in Canada. It has a wholly owned subsidiary known as the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, whose job it is to clear financial transactions involving derivatives.
What does clearing mean?All it means is that when there is a transaction involving derivatives, in other words, when there is a seller of derivatives and a buyer, the clearing house, in this case the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, ensures that the buyer is able to pay the seller and that the seller is able to receive the money from the buyer. This is referred to as clearing a transaction.
There is a problem with how the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation operates, one that Bill S-40 will rectify. Before, the corporation did not afford the same legal protection to buyers and sellers as other clearing houses in North America. In a field that is fiercely competitive, the situation can ariseâand this is what has happened to the Montreal Stock Exchange and to the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporationâwhere derivatives from Canadian companies are listed on foreign exchanges, particularly in the United States, and if they have a clearing house, it is easier to go through an American stock exchange clearing house, instead of using the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation.
This is easy to do, because this is a competitive environment, and made even easier because, without the proper legal protection, the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation was at a disadvantage, since the derivative seller, seeing the increased risk in trading through the Canadian corporation, preferred to trade with American clearing houses.
Once passed, the bill will rectify this problem. I invite all of my colleagues in the House, from all political parties, to support it, because we will solve this problem. We will provide the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation with the competitive capacity it should have had from the outset. We will level the playing field and allow the corporation to face the music and compete with all of the other North American clearing houses.
Passing Bill S-40 will allow the Montreal Stock Exchange to make a major investment in the automated derivatives system.
This would be a first in America. It will also allow investments to increase the growth of transactions on derivatives and will raise the credit rating of the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation.
There will also beâand this is where the beauty of this bill liesâimpacts both upstream and downstream, among them the creation of skilled workers. As we know, the financial sector requires ultra-specialists.
The new environment created by increased prospects at the Montreal Stock Exchange and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation will attract such specialists. It will be far easier for the Montreal Stock Exchange to attract such workers, who are hard to find, even elsewhere in North America.
Given all the advantages offered by Bill S-40, I therefore encourage my colleagues in all parties, in opposition as well as in government, to vote in favour of this bill. As I have said, it will give new life to the Montreal Stock Exchange as a specialized derivatives clearing house, and to the Canadian Derivatives Cleaning Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Montreal Stock Exchange.
Once again, congratulations to all those who have contributed to the drafting of this bill and those who are going to vote in favour. I thank them all in advance.",Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois,Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot,Yvan Loubier,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d3c0bcbc-2d31-4153-9833-c9601f52093e&Language=E&Section=ALL
4213582,ca.proc.d.2002-04-19.1998.147,2002-04-19,63427584-4218-4484-ad50-0c202daf6ac6,133,"Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George--Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance)",,Government Orders,Payment Clearing and Settlement Act,,"Madam Speaker, I know we have heard from the government speaker and my colleague from the Bloc who spoke in support of Bill S-40. I plan to speak on behalf of the Canadian Alliance in support of this bill as well. Although, members know our feeling about bills that originate in the Senate. Although this is an amendment, so it is a little different. We have always held the opinion that bills should originate in this House but we will make an exception here because this is a good bill.
Bill S-40 would amend the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act. It is important to note that this glitch in the act has existed for some time and the government has known about it. The Minister of Finance and his department officials have known that our clearing houses have been operating at a disadvantage to our counterparts, particularly in the G-7, which have made changes to look after the problem involving bankruptcy and dealing with the collateral and derivative contracts.
The government has known about the problem for some time. Principal groups and companies that are involved in this type of business have been saying that there is a problem. On the grand scale of running government, something like this is a minor change that would eminently be beneficial to the various types of clearing houses, to the buyers and sellers who deal with the trading companies, to our competitiveness with our G-7 counterparts in attracting foreign business to our clearing houses and to the people who buy and trade through the clearing houses.
One would think that someone in the finance department would have said âlet's just get this doneâ and make the change. This will not change the direction of the world but it will make the people in Canada who are involved in this sector of our economy a lot happier. They will be able to attract more business, create more jobs and acquire a higher degree of technology in their operations. However this has been dragging on for some time now.
In February the member for Calgary Southeast, who was our finance critic at that time, wrote the finance minister and asked him to introduce the requested amendments as soon as possible. The way the government marks time, February, March, April, a month and a half is really nothing.
There has been precious little other business on the government agenda. It could have introduced the amendment earlier than this. As well, it could have been done even before our finance critic had to write to finance minister to ask him to get on with it. It is just the typical slow wheels of government turning. I have been here since 1993 and I have never seen government wheels turn as slow as I have with this Liberal government.
There are so many issues that parallel the movement on this amendment. One only needs to look at the softwood lumber issue. When the softwood lumber agreement was signed in 1996, there was a set termination date five years hence. The government knew that. It knew it would have to prepare for the eventual end of that agreement.
One would think it would be good government business to begin looking five years ahead from the date the agreement was signed in preparation for when it would run out in order to avoid a trade crisis. The fact is the government simply did not do that. Anyone who has some sort of gift for planning, and one would hope that there would be some in the government who could look further ahead than 10 days, would see that five years from 1996 we would be in some sort of a trade crisis with the United States unless we did some planning.
There were warnings from the official opposition about the perils that lie in the SLA. There were warnings that when the softwood lumber agreement ended we would be in a trade dispute which perhaps would lead to a crisis situation. There were warnings not to get into the SLA in the first place. Despite all the warnings, the government did not move until about six months before the softwood lumber agreement expired. That foot dragging, the same type of foot dragging it did on the amendment to the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, got us into a full scale trade crisis with the United States on softwood lumber.
Now the U.S. is playing hardball. We went into the game at the end of the SLA unprepared hoping that the negotiators and the U.S. forest industry and the lobby group that represents it would somehow do us a favour. Well it does not work that way. They do not do anyone any favours. They play for keeps and they play hardball. Those who are not prepared, as Canada was not, are going to get beat up.
In relation to Bill S-40, this is the sort of the thing that was placing our clearing houses at a disadvantage to our competitive partners in the G-7. The other G-7 partners, as the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions will know, were way ahead of us on this one. Canada was lagging behind.
I am sure the hon. member knows how important this amendment is. Not only should we get it in now but we should have had it in long before now to allow our clearing houses to be more competitive. In particular, the one in Montreal has been really pushing this so it can expand its business. Other similar businesses and clearing houses in Canada could attract foreign business and use the services of the clearing houses with the confidence that the agreements are not going to be held up through some court order due to a bankruptcy from some of their members.
It is important to be on top of things like this and the government simply has not been on top of it. The hon. member, being a former chief economist and a good one at that, has to know how important it was to get this amendment in. However there has been more foot dragging which should not have happened.
We can talk about the slow pace of the Liberal government on a number of other issues and draw parallels to this bill. For example, the part of British Columbia where I live has a huge natural disaster called the pine beetle infestation. The government has known about this situation.
The Pacific forest centre in Victoria that deals with the science of forestry and forest management has known about this and the federal government has known about it for a number of years now. A few short months ago I asked the government if it would come to the assistance of the British Columbia government in fighting the pine beetle infestation.
The answer was that the federal government had not been asked yet. My question had to be, is there anything wrong with being a little proactive on it? Why not call B.C. and ask if the federal government could be of help? There is an obligation on behalf of the federal government to return some of the billions of federal tax dollars that have come out of the British Columbia forest industry.
Just a few short weeks after that day, the British Columbia government did make a formal proposal to the governing Liberals. It presented its five or six year plan to deal with the pine beetle infestation and asked for the federal government's help.
The forest industry is in crisis out there. Tens of thousands of B.C. workers have lost their jobs not only in the forest industry but in related industries. The future of that particular part of the province because of the pine beetle infestation looks dismal.
The fact is the federal government has not responded to the request for help by the Government of British Columbia. That is a shame considering that the B.C. forest industry has sent billions of dollars, perhaps tens of billions of dollars to Ottawa over the last number of decades. The five year plan calls for a total expenditure of about $500 million. That is a very small percentage of what B.C. has sent here. Also it would be a cost sharing plan so perhaps the federal government's share would be down to about $250 million.
The federal government has simply ignored the west once again in the face of a very serious crisis. It has ignored the western forest industry, a prime area of softwood lumber harvest and production in Canada. It has ignored it and allowed the softwood lumber crisis to develop. It has ignored the province of British Columbia, and in particular my riding where literally hundreds of thousands of acres are infested by the pine beetle. It has ignored that.
The government seems to ignore and drag its feet on the real important issues that face various parts of our country, as it has been ignoring this amendment to the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act. Now it is acting on it. It is late but at least the government is acting on it.
While the Liberals tend to delay making decisions on major issues that affect the country, they seem to have no problem when it comes to making a perk-like purchase for the Prime Minister and cabinet, such as a couple of Challenger jets to fly around the country. It took them 10 days to do that. My colleague from Elk Island has been keeping track of the government on this issue.
It appears that one day in the parliamentary restaurant the Prime Minister said to some of his colleagues âListen folks, I may only be around here for another year or year and a half. It would sure be nice to have some new planes to fly around in because I have a lot of countries to see and a lot of people to meet. I want to ensure that my final year or year and a half is filled with a very high degree of comfort and a lot of travel because that is always funâ. It took them 10 days to spend $101 million on Challenger jets.
This has not come up yet but I am sure it will. Under questioning the Minister of Public Works and Government Services said that the planes were ordered from Bombardier because it was the only one that could supply Challenger jets. The government wanted Challenger jets because it already had four Challenger jets and it wanted to stay with the same type of aircraft and therefore Bombardier got the order.
That is the wrong way for a government to order its goods and services. There is a written process. It appears the order was deliberately put through national defence so that the government could avoid going to public tender to allow other companies that build that type of aircraft to bid on it.
Under the procurement guidelines any contract for goods and services over $37,000 must be publicly listed through the MERX system and is open to bid by suppliers in Canada, the United States and Mexico. That is part of the NAFTA agreement. This is the way the rules were set up under NAFTA so that suppliers in the U.S. and Mexico as well as in Canada could bid on these contracts. This was the reason the government established what is called the MERX system, which is being run by one of the major banks, that posts all the requirements for the government on the service so that suppliers can make bids.
When the government is looking to purchase airplanes, it is very deceiving of it to put the tender out in such a way that it names the manufacturer and the brand of aircraft it wants. Under the procurement rules the government should have stated that it needs a passenger jet which must have a certain number of seats, a flight range of x number of miles, a fuel economy of a certain standard and it must be fitted to special requirements regarding avionics and things like that.
That is the way the government should have put that tender into the MERX system which would allow companies that are capable of supplying an aircraft like that to bid on it. It is a public tender. That is what the procurement system in the government is all about. The MERX system is there so that the government can easily put its requirements in front of anyone who chooses to bid on a contract.
There are companies in the United States, such as Gulfstream, Citation, Beachcraft and Lear that build corporate jets. Had the government put the requirements of a type of plane out, it could have had four or five other tenders including Bombardier's. If all the other tenders were simply not suitable, the government could have held them up and said âThese are the tenders we received and here is why we chose Bombardierâ. No one would question that, but the government did not do it.
The government may have another problem with the purchase. It may be in direct violation of the NAFTA rules by not allowing American and Mexican companies to bid on the planes. I would advise the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to be prepared for a NAFTA challenge from a company that could have provided that same plane.
Everything the government needs has to go out to public tender unless for example it is required for a state of emergency or if it is an issue of national security. I suspect that the government put the purchase of these aircraft through national defence hoping that people would think it must have been a security issue and would not worry about it. The people watching the procurement system the government is bound to operate under are a lot smarter than that. I suggest that the government be ready for a NAFTA challenge on the purchase of the aircraft.
I could talk about Kyoto. However the House has heard enough about how the government has been mismanaging that issue so I will instead try to sum up Bill S-40. It is important to point out that Bill S-40 would make technical changes to correct a significant problem faced by certain Canadian clearing houses. Under existing solvency laws derivative contracts are not exempt by court ordered stays. If member corporations go into bankruptcy any collateral deposited at clearing houses is frozen along with other assets. Clearing houses have to line up behind all the other creditors. Our counterparts in the G-7 foresaw this problem years ago and took steps to correct it by introducing legislation. However the Liberal government has not. This has put Canada way behind.
Bill S-40 would bring Canadian law into line with our G-7 counterparts by exempting such collateral deposits from the law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency procedures. This would allow clearing houses to realize collateral deposited by its members without the risk of a court imposed stay. Under existing law Canadian clearing houses operate under a competitive disadvantage compared to derivative clearing houses in the United States and Europe. This is exactly what I was talking about.
Our friends in the G-7 have been way ahead of us on the issue. As a result they have been attracting businesses from outside their countries that have confidence in dealing with them because the flaw in our laws governing the issue does not affect them. The passage of Bill S-40 would put us on a level playing field with our friends in the G-7.
I will make an observation for those who are watching. During a trading day a member of a clearing house will be both a buyer and seller of listed stocks. That is the way it works. Instead of each member making separate settlements with other members a designated central clearing system or clearing house handles the daily settlement process between members. The Montreal stock exchange has spearheaded the effort to change the law but the Liberal government has not listened to it.
Bill S-40 must go through. We in the Canadian Alliance Party will support it. It is about time the bill came forward.
Before I close I am sure the House will allow me to say hello to my father who is watching. He is in Sidney and has been very ill. I told him I would try to brighten his day by saying hello to him. We are hoping all the treatment he is getting will bring his strength back, and I will see him in a couple of weeks.",Canadian Alliance,Prince George--Bulkley Valley,Dick Harris,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=63427584-4218-4484-ad50-0c202daf6ac6&Language=E&Section=ALL
4213583,ca.proc.d.2002-04-19.1998.148,2002-04-19,4ac38ab4-c480-4dde-8f12-a80ff2b4f215,185,"Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)",,Government Orders,Payment Clearing and Settlement Act,,"Madam Speaker, I too am pleased to have the opportunity to join in the debate on Bill S-40, an act to amend the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act.
I will start by saying there is not much in the world I know less about than the clearing of derivatives, et cetera. However I undertook to learn a bit about it so I could convey my party's opinion and the recommendations of our critic. I found it quite fascinating. It is an area of study I have never expressed an interest in or spent a lot of time on but I found it gripping.
I can tell from some of the speeches given today that some people view this as a rather dry issue. I do not. Even as a layperson in the financial market sector I sense there is a crisis of confidence in the financial community on Bay Street, on Wall Street and among major institutional investors. Bill S-40 is one step that may re-instill at least some semblance of confidence because it deals with making sure investments enjoy a greater degree of security.
The bill seeks to amend the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act to permit securities and derivatives clearing houses to realize the collateral of members, for example deposits for commodities, securities, or currency contracts in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. This would give a measure of added confidence to the sector.
Bill S-40 had its genesis in extensive consultations with officials from clearing houses and from the stock exchange in Montreal. The finance critics of all opposition parties had broad consultation and were allowed input at the early stages. This may explain why we are seeing a great deal of co-operation in putting the bill through.
Bill S-40 is a technical bill with only one clause. It is short and to the point. It was expedited through the Senate in only two weeks. The committee stage lasted only an hour. Clearly there was broad consensus that it was a necessary and desirable thing to implement.
Canadian securities and derivatives clearing houses enable consumers and businesses to buy and sell securities and derivatives in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. They do this by providing clearing and settlement services and acting as a central counter party to securities and derivatives trades. This is what our research revealed.
Although the NDP generally and I personally do not have a lot of use for unfettered speculation and are no great friends of derivatives, in researching the issue we have come to learn that there are good and bad derivatives. Our criticism of the speculative derivative market is therefore only valid in a certain sense.
There are good and bad derivatives. Good derivatives help hedge corporate treasuries against risk such as price changes and currency fluctuation risks. There is a role for such derivatives in helping corporations hedge risk with their investments.
Bad derivatives, the ones we are critical of, are about gambling. They are about rolling the dice with people's money. They are about casino capitalism. Speculative derivatives allow corporate or individual gamblers to make bets on the future price of underlying assets by betting a fraction of the cost of an asset. The leverage comes about because the derivative instrument replicates the borrowing or lending of the underlying asset.
This is what I have found although I had to read it a couple of times to get the gist of it. The opportunity for leverage comes about because the derivative instrument involved replicates the borrowing or lending of the underlying asset without ever having to physically own it.
This is an abstract concept a lot of lay people and ordinary Canadians would not necessarily know. However they had better get to know it because it is an unbelievably exploding market. A lot of people's pension dollars may be invested without their knowledge. Money managers who handle employee benefit plans and investments are surely dealing with some of these issues. We should know about it.
I will give members an illustration of the explosion of the derivatives market. Some $64 trillion was traded in derivatives in 1995. In 1997 the figure was $360 trillion. Today more than $1,000 trillion is invested in the derivatives market. Surely we need to take great interest if that is the direction in which the investment marketplace is going.
We view this as a negative. We do not believe such massive investment marketplace can be regulated in an adequate way. As members might expect, the scope and magnitude of the investment marketplace causes major regulatory problems. It is a moving target. Anything growing and expanding at that rate is difficult to nail down. The bigger the corporation the less transparency and accountability. That is what has led to the crisis of confidence in the investment marketplace. It is because of the massive losses of companies like Enron. We have all heard of Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch is being charged by the New York state attorney general for biased research. It is causing a crisis of confidence in the whole financial sector.
As we are dealing with this or trying to get our minds around what $1,000 trillion worth of activity and derivatives speculation looks like we must also try to get our minds around how to safeguard those involved in the massive free for all gambling in the derivatives speculation marketplace.
There are major regulatory problems. The Enron fiasco is only the tip of the iceberg. It was partly due to the fact that derivatives transactions were booked between private parties rather than a public, transparent and fully regulated clearing house system. The failure of auditors and their lack of independence was a contributing factor but the real root of the problem can be traced to the fact that derivatives transactions were booked through private parties rather than a public, transparent and fully regulated clearing system. Anything we can do to alleviate the problem would surely would give comfort to those involved in the financial sector.
A massively leveraged hedge fund was held by Long Term Capital Management fund or LTCM. I am sure most people are familiar with it. It showed up in the news. LTCM had a substantial amount of the world's economy hedged on the future narrowing of interest spreads by the U.S. treasury. It rolled the dice based on the future of narrowing of interest spreads in the U.S.
By mid-1998 LTCM had about $4 billion in equity capital and borrowed funds of about $120 billion, a hefty leverage of about 30 times. Red lights should be going off all over the place when a company is leveraged at 30 times, with $4 billion in equity capital and $120 billion borrowed on something as speculative as the spread between real interest rates. It is a recipe for disaster. Amazingly, the leverage was compounded tenfold by LTCM's off balance sheet derivatives exposures which amounted to another trillion dollars.
These are the stakes the big guys play with. With $4 billion in equity capital LTCM borrowed funds of about $120 billion for a leverage of 30 times. It compounded that tenfold with off balance sheet derivatives exposures that amounted to more than $1 trillion. It is like Rumplestiltskin spinning straw into gold when a company takes $4 billion and spins it into a trillion dollars. It is incomprehensible to little people like us.
A consortium of private banks led by the federal reserve in New York had to bail out LTCM. Fortunately no public sector money was involved, but it goes down in history as one of the biggest runaway freight train catastrophes in financial sector history. The truth of the matter is that we really do not know the long term consequences of what I call derivatives wizardry. We do not know what the real implications are for the real economy. What does it mean to real people? These guys are playing for big stakes in casino style capitalism. They are rolling the dice in this derivatives market and I think they are putting us all at risk.
Frankly, the real losers at Enron were not even the investors and the shareholders but the ordinary Americans who, with confidence, had their pension funds invested in that company on their behalf by money managers. They believed the auditors' accounts. They had no reason not to believe them. They trusted this institution of American capitalism. They thought that a company that big was beyond corruption. People think surely to God a company that big is regulated carefully and analyzed by the government and surely to God somebody is in our corner in that marketplace. It turns out that was not true. Tragically there were snakes at the top who were doing terrible things to thousands and thousands of Americans, because a lot of them have personally directed pension funds, like the Alliance has always advocated. The Alliance wants pension plans to be private, individual accounts that are invested on people's behalf. In this case, people's privately invested accounts disappeared and they lost their retirement security.
The step we are taking today in Bill S-40 is a step in the right direction to help alleviate some of those concerns and some of those fears. Our critic, the member for Regina--Qu'Appelle, who actually knows something about this kind of thing, recommends that we support Bill S-40. He points out some of the positives of Bill S-40, stating that it:

Enhances the stability of the financial system by enabling a securities and derivatives clearing house to immediately realize assets pledged as collateral in the case of default or bankruptcy.

I note as well that the bill will have primacy over the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. In the case of a clearing house being involved, this amendment to the bill will now have primacy over the terms and conditions and the order of disbursement of assets under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
What is good about this change in Bill S-40 is that it guarantees a swift payment of collateral to those clearing houses and ultimately it protects the stability of the system. That is what we are trying to do: restore people's faith in the integrity of the system. Frankly, that faith is wounded. It is damaged, it really is, and that is not good. We live in a system that relies very much on confidence in the system to promote investment. Bill S-40 achieves this by taking a shortcut to override the other bankruptcy legislation, as I have pointed out. It will have primacy over the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
The mainstream argument in favour of Bill S-40 is that the legislation puts Canada on a level playing field with the U.S. and Europe and increases our financial competitiveness and Canada's ability to attract capital. That point has been made adequately by most who have spoken to the bill.
A main beneficiary of the bill would be the Montreal Stock Exchange, which also clears derivatives transactions for the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in my riding of Winnipeg Centre. The Montreal Stock Exchange also specializes in futures.
We normally do not support legislation originating from the other place, but because this is a purely technical bill I think maybe it is a good idea to waste the time of the Senate instead of wasting the time of the House of Commons, so we can in fact approve of the bill coming forward through this method.
I will replay some of the key things. I caution members of the House. The truth of the matter is that we really do not know the long term consequences of derivatives wizardry. We are still critical of what we call the bad derivatives, because it is a rolling of the dice. It is gambling with futures and it is gambling with the confidence of the investment community, with the real implications for the real economy. Are we playing sorcerer's apprentice with the system?
Financial deregulation has expanded the investment horizon of private investors but has also created new systemic risks without really improving access to affordable capital and loans, which is one of the critical requirements for a moving economy. The increasing poverty of so-called emerging countries is an obvious case in point. The disciplining effects of markets adjusting to speculative derivative bursts contribute to endemic deflation, which, I would caution again, hurts the weakest and most vulnerable of countries, especially developing third world nations.
What is key in this debate? We believe that in order to restore confidence in the mainstream investment marketplace it is necessary to obtain a regulatory environment that would mandate transparent, standardized and strictly regulated off balance sheet items such as derivatives. We want to see this regulated for our own protection, not so that the heavy-handed estate interferes with the marketplace but for own protection. All derivative products should fall under that same regulation.
I note that when we dig a little deeper into the details around this amendment to the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, Bill S-40, what it does is provide the Canadian securities and derivatives clearing houses with legal protections similar to those in place in the United States and other G-7 countries in the event that one of their members becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy. There is a remedy put in place that is above and beyond the courts. It saves the lineup for who will divide up the assets of an insolvent company.
With over 190 member firms, the Canadian securities and derivatives industry is a key and vital player in Canada's financial system. The industry provides a mechanism for raising capital, channeling savings into investments and minimizing and hedging risks through these derivatives contracts. To explain the network throughout Canada, the three clearing houses, the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, the Canadian Depository for Securities and the WCE Clearing Corporation, clear and settle trades on four different exchanges, these being the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Bourse de Montreal, the Canadian Venture Exchange in Calgary and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.
As a central counter party, they assume settlement risks, that is, the risk that a member may default before a transaction is settled, which would result in a financial loss to both the clearing house and its members. Because of this, securities and derivatives clearing houses have risk reducing measures that require members to post collateral and net their obligations with the clearing house.
The Canadian securities and derivatives industry is in need of a competitive legal regime that lowers settlement risks for the clearing houses, and we support that point of view, and therefore lowers trading costs. We support that as well. This will make these clearing houses more efficient and competitive with the United States and other G-7 countries.
We are satisfied that the amendments in Bill S-40 accomplish this by expanding the scope of the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act to include legal protection for these securities and derivatives clearing houses of their netting agreements and collateral posted by their members. I would note that the protections being sought are above and beyond the current bankruptcy and insolvency laws.
Before closing I should mention that the changes in the bill are in line with recommendations made by the Bank for International Settlements, which is an international forum that fosters co-operation among central banks and other agencies in the pursuit of monetary and financial stability. The BIS supports a well founded legal basis for securities settlements so that rules and procedures can be enforced with a high degree of certainty.

We think it is a very good move.
It is a bit ironic, perhaps, that here we see government making some very solid, positive moves that would help Canadian companies, whereas just today, and it is an issue I will raise later because it may not entirely be relevant, we see the situation where a government department, in calling tenders for supplies, eliminates small Canadian business, small local competition, and really passes tenders into the hands of large American based companies. There are many areas where we have to scrutinize what we are doing to make sure that perhaps we do as we are doing here, which is to bring in proper legislation and take proper procedures to protect our own companies so we can be competitive in the overall marketplace.
Increasingly Canadian companies are going to the United States markets to meet their funding needs. Our largest companies trade more shares on the United States exchanges than on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The past three years have seen net portfolio investment go from an inflow of $14 billion per year to an alarming outflow of $30 billion per year. This is extremely serious. During that period of time, foreign purchases of Canadian companies have outweighed Canadian acquisitions of foreign companies by more than $75 billion. As these companies come under foreign ownership, their financing activities move out of the country.
In addition, the present circumstances make it very difficult to nurture new companies because they do not have access to adequate capital. Furthermore, they are unable to attract attention in the United States marketplace or even meet the higher U.S. listing requirements.
Bill S-40 is one of the initiatives that would reverse this trend. It is a step toward addressing the declining competitiveness of the Canadian economy and the declining liquidity of the Canadian capital markets.
The globalization of financial markets in recent years has permitted investors to move their investments rapidly away from riskier markets to others where the legislative framework is friendlier and less risky. In the United States, bankruptcy and insolvency legislation generally exempts securities clearing organizations from court ordered stays and allows them to net the obligations of members and to realize on their members' collateral. Thus, some trades that could and should occur in Canada, particularly in derivatives, are being handled in the United States because of the risk issue on the Canadian exchanges and the lack of protection in our bankruptcy and insolvency legislation. In particular, the Bourse de Montreal, Canada's major derivatives exchange, is at a marked disadvantage compared to exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Exchange.
The securities and derivatives industry is very significant for our Canadian economy. Strong and competitive Canadian financial markets are the key to the overall growth and prosperity of the nation. However, it is difficult to attract large international dealers if Canadian clearing houses face higher costs as a result of their inability to enforce their netting and collateral agreements with their members or because they present greater risks to the participants in the event of the insolvency of one or more members.
Clearing houses for Canadian securities and structured products such as derivatives and options must be able to clear transactions in a timely manner, but under existing law in Canada they cannot clear transactions when either the buyer or the seller becomes insolvent. The various Canadian laws that currently govern bankruptcy and insolvency, namely the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Winding-up and Restructuring Act, do not offer Canadian clearing houses the same protection that is offered in the laws of other G-7 countries.
This is of great concern to the four exchanges in Canada that trade in securities and structure products, namely the TSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Bourse de MontrÃ©al, the Canadian Venture Exchange in Calgary and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. This is also of great concern to the three clearing houses that clear the trades of the four exchanges, namely the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, the Canadian Depository for Securities and the WCE Clearing Corporation.
The Bourse de MontrÃ©al, on behalf of the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation and the two remaining clearing houses, have all asked that the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act be amended to cover securities and derivatives clearing houses.
Bill S-40 is designed to provide clearing houses with the legal protection they need in the event one of the trading parties becomes insolvent or bankrupt.
The amendments in Bill S-40 would expand the scope of Canada's Payment Clearing and Settlement Act by providing protection for the netting agreements for our securities and derivatives clearing houses. They would also provide protection for the collateral posted by the members of the clearing houses.
Passing the bill will encourage both domestic and foreign investments in Canadian companies. That is what we want. We do not want to see this business going to the United States. We should not only hold our own here in Canada, but we should entice foreign investment here as well. We can only do that if we are competitive.
Should Canada fail to adapt its financial legislation to international norms, there is a clear danger that a significant number of Canadian businesses will move to foreign markets.
Bill S-40 will ensure that the Canadian market enjoys the same protection that is provided in the other G-7 countries. It will enhance our competitive position by enabling clearing houses to lower their costs by reducing the settlement risks caused by poor bankruptcy protection. Thus it will allow our financial markets and institutions to grow their business in Canada and reclaim certain specialized financial business that has moved to foreign markets. It may also attract new investors from the United States and other foreign countries.
It should be noted that the amendments to the bill follow up on the November 2001 recommendations made by the Bank of International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.
One of the central recommendations was that the transactions involving the clearing houses have a well-founded legal basis so that their rules and procedures could be enforced with a high degree of certainty. This includes the enforceability of transactions, netting arrangements and liquidation of assets pledged or transferred as collateral.
Bill S-40 will help more of our financial markets to become more competitive. However more work needs to be done.
Tax reform is crucial. Despite federal and provincial tax cuts, Canadian taxes are still higher than in the United States, and the United States rates are scheduled to decline even more over the next four years.
A modern regulatory structure that will work in a fast paced marketplace is also necessary. We must eliminate rules that are duplicative, contradictory or not in the public's interest. Financing in Canada is more expensive and complicated than it should be. Each new regulatory policy should undergo a rigorous cost benefit analysis and be implemented in a way that minimizes cost and excessive red tape. How often have we heard that?
A single and national governing body must also be created to oversee Canada's financial markets. The multiple Canadian regulatory authorities have created a fragmented and decentralized system.
In conclusion, securities and derivatives clearing houses are crucial to the efficient operation of our financial markets. Bill S-40 will allow them to reduce costs, because of better bankruptcy protection legislation and thus become more internationally competitive. The bill, in conjunction with tax reform, reducing the regulatory burden, and consolidating the many financial market regulatory authorities will help restore Canada's competitiveness.
After all that is what collectively we should all be doing; ensuring that we are a major player in the financial markets in the world. We can be. We have everything here that would draw investment. The only thing we need is the will to ensure that investors feel comfortable, get a fair deal and we can compete with other countries around the world.",Progressive Conservative,St. John's West,Loyola Hearn,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=bf91629c-065c-4bb5-8b0f-5ea45f263d3a&Language=E&Section=ALL

That, in the opinion of this House, the government should create a personal retirement account whereby Canadians may be given an after-tax option for pension savings.
Madam Speaker, I started working on this motion back in 1998 and it has been a long dusty road to get it here. I am delighted to speak to my private member's Motion No. 357.
What I am recommending is that another vehicle for retirement income be added to the array currently in existence in the Canada retirement income system. I call this the personal retirement account. It is not unlike the Roth IRA, which was recently introduced into the U.S. tax system for Americans wishing to save for their retirement by contributing after tax money into an individual registered account in which any growth is sheltered from all future taxation. Americans have had this popular new alternative at their disposal since 1998.
This savings vehicle offers no immediate tax benefit. Instead, interest dividends or capital gains income earned in the retirement account accumulate free of tax. The intention would be that withdrawals of principal and earnings after a specified age, for example age 60, are free of tax as long as the plan has been in existence for five years.
Most Canadians understand the basic concept of our current retirement income system which consists of public and private components. The public component consists of old age security and guaranteed income supplement for Canadians with lower incomes and the Canada and Quebec pension plans.
The private savings component is in the category of registered retirement savings plans, otherwise known as RRSPs, or registered pension plans, RPPs. I am proposing is a Canadian alternative for private savings under a personal retirement account which will utilize after tax money as opposed to the RRSP which defers current taxes until withdrawals are made from the RRSP and treated as income later. This income is then taxed.
Since the Roth IRA was offered to Americans in 1998, it has proven to be very popular. I believe the option I am presenting to put after tax money into a personal retirement account where all future growth in income would be sheltered from taxation, would be popular with Canadians and would offer them an alternative which would encourage them to save for their retirement.
A simple analysis clearly indicates that both an RRSP and an after tax personal retirement account are preferable to saving in an ordinary bank account. It is important for the government to encourage private savings for retirement. The federal government must plan for its tax revenues based on projections of changes to revenue based on people's retirement savings behaviour. RRSPs tend to defer taxes more than reduce taxes so what the government loses in revenues upfront, it tends to gain later.
If Canadians were offered a choice of an after tax personal retirement account, as I am recommending, and if it became as popular as it apparently is in the U.S., federal tax revenues would easily increase by several billion dollars in the next few years. Furthermore, if, as the Americans have done, Canadians were given the option of converting funds in existing RRSPs into these after tax personal retirement accounts, the federal government would enjoy a further tax windfall. The government would want to offer both RRSPs and personal retirement accounts and would have to take into account the impact of when taxation of revenues would be received.
The current demographics indicate that between 1995 and 2030, seniors, as a percentage of the working age population, will increase from 20% to 39%. This makes it essential that private savings be encouraged to enhance the public portion of retirement income which will obviously be seriously under strong pressure with current projections indicating a shortfall.
The aging of the population will have a profound impact on the ability of the government to provide programs to allow retirees to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Some of the characteristics that I would suggest as being appropriate for an after tax personal retirement account might look like the following description although the details are obviously flexible and specific details should not be used as ammunition to support or criticize the concept since they are not part of my motion and would be subject to the design of the government. I am merely offering suggestions to allow for clarity of understanding as to how an after tax personal retirement account might work.
First, the after tax personal retirement account should be created regardless of other recognized retirement schemes then in effect. Contributions allowed to the after tax personal retirement account should not be linked in any way to the contributions allowed for other retirement plans or schemes.
Second, the money contributed to the personal retirement account should consist of after tax dollars. Any contributions made to the account should not be tax deductible. However, any income earned and any withdrawals made from the personal retirement account should not be taxable.
Third, an individual may contribute a maximum of $5,000 in after tax dollars in each taxation year to personal retirement accounts.
Fourth, the individual contributor may use the unused portion of each year's allotted $5,000 in subsequent years.
Fifth, individual contributors may contribute their money to an after tax personal retirement account that belongs to their spouse or child as defined in the Income Tax Act.
Sixth, an individual may contribute to any after tax personal retirement account regardless of whether or not that individual is an income earner.
Seventh, there should be no age restrictions whatsoever on the after tax personal retirement account. Any individual may contribute after tax dollars to any personal retirement account at any time. Any individual who owns or is the beneficiary of an after tax personal retirement account may withdraw funds from his or her account at any time.
Eighth, the individual owner or beneficiary of an after tax personal retirement account should be able to invest in any investment vehicle provided that a record is kept of the invested funds of the income earned on the said investment.
Ninth, all after tax personal retirement accounts should be fully transferable on death with no tax implications for the funds retained within the account, including any income earned within the personal retirement account. Personal retirement account owners should be able to transfer their account to any other individual they choose. An individual transferee in this context should only include natural persons.
Tenth, withdrawals of principal or interest from an after tax personal retirement account should not be treated as income for any purpose.
There are obviously a host of other details and administration that would be required, but certainly the PRA would prove to be no more cumbersome to administer than a registered retirement savings plan account. For many people the certainty that all income generated would not be subject to future taxation at some uncertain rate of tax would be a huge incentive. It is my belief that it would encourage a substantial number of people who do not currently save through RRSPs for retirement because they do not see any certainty of advantage to saving subject to future taxation with the uncertainty of future rates of taxation.
Just as with the Canadian system of registered retirement savings plan modifications over time, there would be modifications in design of the after tax personal retirement account. For example, the Roth individual retirement account in the U.S. allows contributions to be used, up to $10,000 if it has been in the plan for five years, to purchase a first home. The U.S. has also built in an education savings component.
Many Canadians who put money into an RRSP during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s would have been better off with an after tax personal retirement account because in many respects they are facing tax rates upon retirement that are higher than when they were making the contributions.
My proposal for an after tax personal retirement account would be a private retirement savings vehicle in addition to RRSPs and registered pension plans and not designed to replace any of the current retirement income vehicles.
Most RRSP contributors would, in all likelihood, choose to contribute to an RRSP and also contribute to the new after tax PRA. Many people are looking for as much certainty as possible for their retirement planning and the after tax PRA would certainly be appealing from the standpoint that revenue would not be taxed after taken out after a certain age.
In the U.S., 59 and a half years of age has been designated as the age after which non-penalty of withdrawals occurs. It is my belief that any negative long term revenue impacts to the government would be offset by the fact that retired persons would be more self-supporting. The principle that the after tax PRA and earnings within it would belong to the taxpayer and could be withdrawn without the huge penalty normally associated with the early withdrawal from an RRSP would be a real advantage.
The U.S. applies a 10% early withdrawal penalty for any withdrawals of earnings before reaching the age of 59 and a half when withdrawing from a Roth IRA. Contributions however, not earnings, may be withdrawn from a Roth IRA without penalty at any age. This kind of flexibility would be very attractive to a great number of people.
The government has not had a significant reform to the retirement income system for Canadians for many years. The after tax personal retirement account that this motion is advocating would be a positive and exciting addition and alternative for Canadians who are increasingly concerned about how to structure their financial affairs for their senior years. For example, in 1998 fewer Canadians contributed to an RRSP than in 1997. This trend is worrisome. In 1998 only a minority of tax filers under age 65 contributed to their RRSP account. This worked out to 40% for men and 30% for women.
I offer this motion as advocating what could be an exciting addition to the retirement income vehicles available to Canadians.",Canadian Alliance,Vancouver Island North,John Duncan,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cb60b9db-e3bd-48d9-af20-0b0702a06589&Language=E&Section=ALL
4213595,ca.proc.d.2002-04-19.1998.160,2002-04-19,270eed77-cf5d-4c14-9ee8-2e8ad61fba99,304,"Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.)",,Private Members' Business,Pension Savings,,"Mr. Speaker, the motion proposes the introduction of what are commonly referred to as tax prepaid savings plans, TPSPs.
Hon. members may be aware TPSPs have been proposed by the C.D. Howe Institute and others as a new retirement savings vehicle to complement the existing system of registered pension plans, RPPs, and registered retirement savings plans, RRSPs.
I welcome the initiative of the hon. member for Vancouver Island North in putting forward the motion to the House. Tax prepaid savings plans are an interesting idea and worth exploring. While TPSPs may offer certain benefits they also raise a number of important issues.
I would like to review the current retirement income system and the system of tax assistance for retirement savings and touch on some of the issues surrounding TPSPs.
Hon. members may be aware Canada's retirement income system is composed of three pillars. These three pillars help achieve two basic objectives. First, to ensure a basic minimum income guarantee for all seniors. Second, to enable Canadians to avoid serious disruptions in their living standards upon retirement.
The first pillar compromises the old age security and guaranteed income supplement programs, which provide a basic minimum income guarantee for seniors.
The second pillar is the Canada and Quebec pension plans, which provide a basic level of earning replacement in retirement.
The third pillar is the current system of tax assistance for retirement savings. As hon. members are well aware this system provides Canadians with opportunities to save on a tax-assisted basis. Individuals may contribute 18% of earnings per year to an RRSP, a registered pension plan, or a combination of both, up to a maximum dollar limit of $13,500. For defined pension plans benefits are limited to 2% of earnings per year of service up to a dollar maximum of $1,722, which corresponds to 2% of $86,100. These limits allow a pension equal to 70% of covered pre-retirement earnings after a 35 year career.
The pension and RRSP maximum contribution limits are legislated to increase from $13,500 to $15,500 by 2004 and 2005 respectively, and be indexed to average wage growth thereafter. The $1,722 maximum pension limit for defined benefit pension plans is legislated to be indexed to an average wage growth starting in 2005.
The government's commitment to the pension and RRSP system is significant. According to estimates published last year the federal government will provide tax assistance of more than $14 billion this year alone on savings in RPPs and RRSPs. It is clear that the government's investment is significant.
Statistics Canada data indicates that Canadians had accumulated assets of more than $1 trillion in RPPs and RRSPs in 1999, accounting for 34% of all assets owned by Canadian households. Seventy-one per cent of all family units had assets in registered plans in 1999.
Most members would agree with me when I say that the current system of tax assistance for retirement savings has been a success, given the statistics that I just mentioned. Indeed Canada's retirement income system is regarded as an excellent system internationally and has been cited as such by the OECD, the World Bank and the IMF.
Nevertheless, this would not prevent the government from considering further measures to encourage and assist retirement savings in Canada and to make the tax-assisted savings system as fair and effective as possible, given competing needs and available fiscal resources. In this context tax prepaid savings plans are an idea worth examining.
I would like to raise some of the questions that need to be examined with respect to TPSPs but before that, allow me to explain exactly what TPSPs are, how they would work and the sense in which the tax is prepaid.
It is easier to see how TPSPs would work by comparing them to RRSPs which everyone is familiar with. An RRSP is an example of a tax deferred savings plan. Contributions to RRSPs are tax deductible. Investment income earned within RRSPs accrues free of tax. Withdrawals from RRSPs are taxable. In this sense the tax owing on contributions and investment income is deferred until the funds are withdrawn from the RRSP.
In contrast, contributions to a TPSP would not be tax deductible but investment income and withdrawals from the plan would not be subject to tax. The tax would be prepaid because contributions would be made from after tax dollars. Under certain conditions the tax assistance benefits to savers and the net costs to the government under a TPSP would be identical to those associated with an RRSP.
As some hon. members may be aware, tax prepaid plans exist in other countries notably the United States and United Kingdom. In the United States they are known as Roth IRAs. In the U.K. they are called individual savings accounts or ISAs. Since tax prepaid plans are being used in other countries hon. members may wonder why we cannot adopt them here. The U.S. and the U.K. have different systems for retirement income and tax assistance for savings than we have in Canada.
It is not clear that TPSPs should be adopted in Canada simply because they exist in other countries. We should first study fully their implications. Many questions need to be examined in assessing the appropriateness of TPSPs for Canada. First, how would a TPSP program fit in with the tax assisted retirement savings programs currently in place?
Second, what would be the impact on government revenues of introducing TPSPs?
Third, should income earned within a TPSP be taken into account in determining income tested tax and social benefits such as old age security and guaranteed income supplement benefits?
Fourth, would a tax prepaid option for retirement savings be attractive to savers given that the Liberal government has introduced the largest tax cut in Canadian history and future tax rates are declining?
The question of introducing TPSPs would have to be considered in the context of the many competing tax and investment needs for available fiscal resources. These and other issues need to be examined.
Before concluding I will take the opportunity to remind hon. members of the recent tax reductions made by the Liberal government. In the October 2000 economic statement and budget update the federal government announced the largest tax cut in our history. Canadians are already benefiting from the tax reduction plan. The tax cuts are providing significant stimulus to the economy and contributing to building a strong economy in the future.
The tax reductions will lower the personal income tax burden by 21% on average and by 27% for families with children by 2004-05. In addition, the reductions are promoting jobs, growth, entrepreneurship and innovation by creating a Canadian advantage in the taxation of businesses and capital gains relative to the United States. The tax reduction plan provided tax relief of about $17 billion in 2001 and will provide about $20 billion in tax relief this year.
Among the personal income tax reductions announced in the 2000 budget and the October 2000 economic statement and budget update were the restoration of full indexation of the tax system, the lowering of tax rates for all taxpayers, legislated increases in the tax bracket thresholds by 2004, and a reduction in the capital gains inclusion rate. These measures are putting more money in the pockets of Canadians, money they can choose to save and invest.
To conclude, it is not appropriate to support the motion when many important issues regarding TPSPs still need to be carefully examined and assessed. Furthermore, as I mentioned in my remarks, pension and RRSP limits are scheduled to increase beginning next year with limits being indexed to an average wage growth beginning in 2005 for RPPs and in 2006 for RRSPs.
Again, I thank the hon. member for putting the motion forward and giving us a chance to address it today.",Liberal,Oak Ridges,Bryon Wilfert,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=270eed77-cf5d-4c14-9ee8-2e8ad61fba99&Language=E&Section=ALL

It reads:

That, in the opinion of this House, the government should create a personal retirement account whereby Canadians may be given an after-tax option for pension savings.

I do not support the motion because it would be a way for Canadians with middle to high incomes to escape paying taxes. Let us face it, the motion is calling for a situation whereby people who had money to put into private investment accounts would not need to pay taxes on those accounts. The motion would create a government sponsored personalized tax haven for every Canadian who could afford it.
That is a bad idea. Unlike RRSPs and pension plans which are tax holidays these accounts would be tax exemptions, pure and simple. Most people I know who play the stock market are not the ones in society who need tax breaks.
Besides the general unfairness of creating another tax loophole for people with money to play the stock market while the government still forces single mothers on welfare to pay the GST, the motion would create an overall policy problem by depriving the government of revenue. The sad consequence of people being allowed to escape paying their fair share of taxes is the continued deterioration of public services like medicare or the pension system. I would prefer the House to look at ways of increasing public support for institutions like our pension system, public education system and health care system.
Let us look at the values of Canadians in this regard. Canadians do not mind paying taxes as long as they know the taxes will be used for the benefit of the community. They do not mind paying if the result will be more public transit, better public housing, support for their neighbours with disabilities and generous support for seniors.
My constituents get angry when they pay unfair levels of taxes. They get angry when they pay 40% or 50% marginal tax rates on modest incomes while the wealthiest families are able to shuffle billions of dollars out of the country in family trusts without paying tax and with the permission of the government.
My constituents lose confidence in the system when they pay 40% tax rates but see their health care system underfunded; transfers cut to the provinces for education; people paying into the employment insurance scheme who are unable to collect; and families of our Canadian forces who have to visit food banks to make it through the month. Canadians lose confidence when at the same time corporations get huge tax cuts, private companies make huge profits doing the work of recently privatized public services, and companies that should be contributing to local communities are instead lining up to the government with lists of social and economic demands in the name of globalization.
If hon. members do not believe we can rebuild our public services with higher taxes they should check this week's budget in Great Britain. The British government raised taxes and ran a temporary deficit so it could pay for a 41% increase in funding for the national health service and substantial increases in essential public services like education and transportation. That is the kind of economic direction I can wholeheartedly support.
The system proposed by Motion No. 357 would fundamentally undermine that. A personal retirement account that is never taxed would ultimately undermine the Canada Pension Plan and our RRSP system.
Under the present system people can put a portion of their income into an RRSP. The amount put into the RRSP does not count as income for the tax year in which the contribution is made. Upon retirement when people's incomes are usually lower and their tax rates are less they can take money from their RRSP accounts and the withdrawals are taxed at the lower rate. RRSPs are a tax holiday but the government gets the revenue eventually. Under Motion No. 357 there would be no tax deferral or holiday but a total loss of income for the government.
I am wondering if the member actually believes that we do not need revenue to pay for our social programs, such as pensions. Does he not see that the consequences of gutting income for government is the gutting of programs which help people?
I believe it is morally backward that wealthy families should receive retirement benefits in the form of a tax exempt retirement allowance at the cost of the existence of public pension plans for the poor. It is wrongheaded to say the least.
In conclusion I hope the member for Vancouver Island North will abandon this notion of tax exemptions for families who can afford large savings and work with New Democrats to develop policies that will put a fair tax system in place which will support reliable and sustainable public services like pensions and health care.",New Democratic Party,Dartmouth,Wendy Lill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=40e50704-8f9f-4468-93fd-1abf14fff088&Language=E&Section=ALL

The Progressive Conservative Party certainly supports any initiative that offers flexibility to the Canadian public in preparing for retirement. However there are many alternatives to Motion No. 357 that should be considered in this context.
Tax reform as always warrants serious consideration. For example, eliminating the capital gains tax, which is something the Progressive Conservative Party strongly advocates, in addition to alleviating the tax burden on those saving for retirement, will also stem the flow of skilled workers to the United States. We see capital gains as a very regressive and punishing tax for Canadians.
Canada is losing too much of its knowledge and too many of its workers to our southern neighbour. This has serious implications for our long term economic health. Government policy should be geared toward ending brain drain as quickly as possible. Canada's brain drain is a problem of quality, not quantity. Those leaving for the United States surely represent a valuable section of Canada's human resources pool.
The current Prime Minister has suggested that Canadians should leave the country if they are unhappy with Canada's tax. This surely is a further sign of arrogance and disconnect on the part of the Prime Minister with respect to Canada's youth. When Canada loses it brightest and best young people, it loses the capital and the talent essential to generate a higher level of productivity. We know we need to be more productive in this country.
The elimination of the capital gains tax is also the most direct way to unlock and speed the flow of private equity financing. A study in the United States demonstrates that eliminating the capital gains tax completely in that country would lead to a $300 billion increase in national output. That amounts to nearly one million new jobs and an additional $46 billion in tax revenues due to the economic growth.
The United Kingdom, Germany, Norway and Sweden have adopted a more aggressive tax cutting strategy than Canada. Germany reduced its capital gains by 50%, Great Britain by 75%. Norway has eliminated completely all forms of double taxation on capital income. We should look to those countries for inspiration.
President John F. Kennedy spoke disparagingly about the capital gains tax as early as 1963. He stated:

The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital, and the ease or difficulty experienced by the new ventures in obtaining capital.

Allan Greenspan, the chairman of the federal reserve, stated in 1997 shortly after the United States capital gains rate was cut:

If the capital gains were eliminated, we would presumably, over time, see increased economic growth which would raise revenues for the personal and corporate taxes. Its major impact is to impede entrepreneurial activity and capital formation.

The Progressive Conservative Party also strongly supports the Standing Committee on Finance's recommendations to eliminate the remaining capital gains tax for gifts of listed securities. This is the single most important step the government can take to improve funding for the charitable sector and in so doing strengthen Canada's social support network.
Time and time again we are seeing charitable organizations doing the work that used to be assumed by government. We certainly should be, at the very least, getting out of the way of their ability to raise capital for worthy causes in this country.
Numerous presentations have been made to the House of Commons finance committee by the non-profit sector urging the permanent elimination of the capital gains tax on gifts of publicly listed securities. The government has made permanent a reduction to capital gains tax on publicly listed securities, but that was simply a baby step in the right direction.
The Canadian philanthropic sector, Canadian charities whether a university foundation, the United Way or a hospital foundation, is at a competitive disadvantage when competing with funds currently being drawn in places in the United States and the United Kingdom and those outside Canada.
The government has not worked with the non-profit sector to make it easier for Canadian institutions, the non-profit sector, universities, hospitals, foundations and charities to raise money that is necessary, particularly during the period of decreased federal and provincial funding.
The elimination of personal capital gains tax would also dramatically strengthen Canada's venture capital community.
A look at reducing income tax among others is also needed. In the old economy the purpose of taxes was to redistribute income. In the new economy high taxes redistribute people. When Canada's tax policy dictates that workers earning just $100,000, which sounds like an exorbitant amount, pay half their income in taxes, those highly valued workers will certainly look elsewhere. By comparison, in the United States we would almost have to go to an income range approaching $400,000 to reach that same income tax bracket.
This is particularly risky for Canada in the digital economy where valuable intellectual property, assets, expertise and energy depart with every professional who crosses the border.
In the United States the highest rate of taxation does not apply until income reaches the range of $400,000. An American earning $100,000 will pay only one-quarter of that amount. It takes a considerable degree of patriotism and choosing Canada's quality of life over that of sheer return to make the choice to stay home. Although many Canadians continue to stay home, they do so at a competitive disadvantage. We should do everything we can to get out of the way of disincentives that drive our best and brightest outside of Canada for them to achieve their potential.
The people who are tempted to leave are those with fewer roots in our country and less attachment to some of the lifestyle advantages. They are often young people who the country needs to grow and prosper. They are young people like our pages who are here working very hard to further their careers while studying, who work every day to help members of parliament with their daily duties.",Progressive Conservative,Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough,Peter MacKay,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=46dccbed-4370-40f0-975f-d08fe1688aa2&Language=E&Section=ALL

Many students graduating from an undergraduate degree today are leaving their studies with the equivalent of a mortgage to pay back with no house in which to live. For future generations and for the current generation, this is a huge and often insurmountable hurdle to get over. Many declare personal bankruptcy as they start out in life. As they start on their new careers, they face that very daunting prospect of forfeiting their credit rating by declaring personal bankruptcy for investing in their own future by furthering their education and pursuing a degree.
The people who are tempting to leave do so with very heavy hearts. We in the maritimes in particular have faced this for 100 years or more. The very best, the talented young people who have educated themselves and have a great sense of tradition and attachment to their communities and towns and villages face this very gut-wrenching decision of having to leave to work. Contrary to the opinions of many, the people of the Atlantic provinces are not unlike any other region in the country. They simply want to have an opportunity to work, live and contribute in their communities.
Taxing income discourages people from earning, saving and investing, all of which are crucial to economic growth in Canada. If we continue down this path and this philosophy of punishing those who are more productive then we will see that the productivity continue to wane.
According to Jack Mintz, a professional on taxation at the University of Toronto's J.L. Rotman School of Management , the costs in terms of lost output are $15 billion to $140 billion a year or from $500 to $4,500 per person annually.
We should also target capital taxes, high sales taxes on business outputs and high personal taxes on business owners. A more progressive step would be for the government to shift from investment and savings taxes to consumption based taxes. Dare I say it, the GST, the much hated tax, was introduced with that very much in mind, a consumption tax that was fair and that was meant to be attached to the deficit. Canada could adopt a personal expenditure tax and more taxes on the user pay principle.",Progressive Conservative,Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough,Peter MacKay,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=46dccbed-4370-40f0-975f-d08fe1688aa2&Language=E&Section=ALL

I find the various viewpoints very interesting, particularly those of my NDP friends. I am absolutely amazed that they could so totally miss the point of what we are talking about today. This is a pre-tax paid plan. In other words, we pay the tax upfront and the government gets revenue now instead of having to wait for it, but the NDP says that it is not fair. I do not know why they make that conclusion because this is giving people a further option.
When it comes to retirement incomes, we must as a government address this issue with a view to improving the purchasing capacity of our seniors when they retire. In the fall of 2000, when this reporter phoned me to ask how things were going in my riding, I told him that one thing I was hearing from seniors was that they were having trouble making ends meet, and we need to fix that.
Seniors across this country have month by month incomes that are barely sufficient to pay their property taxes or rent, utilities, food and clothing. Many of them cannot afford to do a number of things they would like to do because of this.
One lady called me. She said that when she and her husband were working they skimped and saved to provide for their retirement but, unfortunately, her husband passed away. Her roof was leaking and she needed $3,000 for repairs. Lo and behold, when she withdrew $3,000 from her RRSP account, the government took 40% of it. Therefore, she had to make another $3,000 withdrawal. She told me she was worried that she would run out of money before she died.
That is a real concern to me. It is so important for us to think about this issue. I really appreciate my colleague bringing this motion to the House today so we can begin to address this issue. What can we do to improve it? What can we do to provide for our seniors on retirement an income which is adequate to meet their needs after all taxes have been paid, regardless of this scheme, whether the taxes are paid in advance, as is in the scheme proposed by my colleague today, or whether those taxes are paid in retrospect?
The parliamentary secretary says that the Canada pension plan is the answer; it is one of the pillars. If one does the mathematics on it, it is pretty well the worst retirement investment a person can make. My calculations showed that instead of getting an annual income of about $9,000 a year, as one does with the Canada pension plan, one could actually get an income of up to $10,000 a month if that money were adequately invested over a person's lifetime. That is a huge difference. We need to look at that. We always are considering the taxes on this and when they are collected.
The NDP is totally wrong in thinking that increasing tax rates also increases tax revenue. There is a very well known economic theory, by a Professor Laffer so it is called the Laffer curve, which states that somewhere between an income tax rate of 0% and 100% is a maximum rate.
It is easy to think about this. I want members to think about someone selling something. For example, a hockey team owner is thinking of selling tickets to hockey games. We are thinking of hockey in Canada these days. He decides to charge zero dollars for the tickets. The place will be packed and the fans will be cheering and his income will be zero, because zero dollars per ticket times 40,000 tickets equals zero. Let us say on the other hand that he decides to charge $10,000 per ticket. I suppose there would be a few really rich people who would like to show off their money who would bring their two or three kids or relatives and pay $40,000 to go to a hockey game at night. At that price I think there would probably only be four people in the stands and the rest of the seats would be empty. For all practical purposes, we could say that if the rate per seat is high then the number of seats purchased will be zero, and again we have zero times the number which is zero. With zero dollars per ticket, the income is zero. With $10,000 per ticket the income is as good as zero. However, in between there is a number.
Let us take it up $1 at a time. Let me use a 40,000 seat stadium as an example, where it costs $1 per ticket. Now the income is $40,000. If ticket prices were increased to $2, I would venture to say that the stadium would still be full. Then there would be an income of $80,000. Ticket prices could be increased to $3 with still no change in the number of people buying them, and the individual would be making $120,000. At those low rates, increasing the amount per seat will not do anything other than double or triple income every time, but there comes a place somewhere between zero dollars per ticket and $10,000 per ticket where income reaches a maximum. After that, a further increase in price reduces income because people stop going.
The same thing is true with tax rates. If we had a 0% tax rate, government revenue would be zero, our economy would be doing great and maybe we would not need any taxes because we could look after ourselves and our neighbours. Everybody would have jobs. For those who were disabled and did not have any jobs, we would look after them, because we are good charitable people in this country. Maybe we have too much government, but I still believe we need to have a government that functions in certain areas.
On the other hand, if we had a tax rate of 100% government tax revenue would be zero because nobody would get up in the morning and go to work. There might be a few workaholics who would go out and earn $100 and then send it to the government. Interestingly, somebody e-mailed me a new simplified tax form consisting of two lines. I presume he did this because it is tax season. Line number one asked how much money was earned. Line number two said to send it in. However, if the 100% rate scheme were adopted government revenue would be zero. It must be somewhere in between.
I would like to inform members of the NDP that sometimes reducing tax rates by 4% or 5% can actually increase government revenue. This has been proven. Why would we not do it? Why would we not reduce tax rates, leave more money in the hands of the people and let them look after themselves in a better way? Meanwhile this would increase tax revenues so the government could do more. It is just an oversimplification to think this stuff is linear, as we say in mathematics. Indeed, it is not linear at all.
As a parliament, we need to commit to looking at retirement incomes, at the different plans that are available, at the different ways of taxing them, and we certainly are as a party, but the objective is and always must be this: How can we set things up so that on retirement our seniors have a maximum amount of income after all of those taxes so they can meet their needs and live in comfort? I do not think we want to say they should live in luxury. They should live in comfort with their needs being met and without having to worry where the next meal is coming from or whether they can afford a new shirt.",Canadian Alliance,Elk Island,Ken Epp,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=3d4d512d-0489-4ea8-a561-86db66a98e16&Language=E&Section=ALL

The message and signal that I heard from the parliamentary secretary was that the finance department welcomes this initiative. Obviously I am pleased to hear that. I am pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance say this concept of an after tax personal retirement account is worth investigating.
It is my belief that many Canadians would endorse this initiative if and when they become aware of the concept. I welcome the parliamentary secretary's statements as they probably represent the view of the department.
The parliamentary secretary was correct that there are many questions and much research that needs to be done in order to determine the appropriate design of an after tax personal retirement account. I also said that in my speech. All the points I made were only examples in order to lead the discussion in the right direction.
I urge the department to get on with it. I thank the parliamentary secretary for his supportive comments but there was no sense of urgency. If it were a worthy initiative then we should simply get on with it.
I share the concern of my colleague from Elk Island. Canadians are feeling poorer, especially our seniors. They do need other options available to them to look at when they reach retirement.
The hon. member for Dartmouth missed my point. The government gets the taxes sooner rather than later. The hon. member for Dartmouth talked about this retirement savings vehicle and described it as a tax loophole. It is hardly a loophole. As a matter of fact many governments would view this as a tax grab, a tax windfall. That is exactly my point. It is not a tax loophole. Taxes are paid up front rather than deferred until later.
Many low income earners would choose this after tax way of saving for retirement because of the certainty of what their later income would be, or could be, and also because withdrawals in a flexible way would have no impact on income for taxation purposes when people are more vulnerable to government tax grabs. That is the point the hon. member for Elk Island made with the senior with the leaky roof. Those kind of rainy day withdrawals would be much more enabled through an after tax personal retirement account than under the RRSP program.
I am not arguing against an RRSP program. I am saying a judicious mix of the two would be appropriate. The hon. member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough spoke on the motion and I too advocate other tax relief measures.
