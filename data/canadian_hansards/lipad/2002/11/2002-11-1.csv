The bill relates to Canada's ongoing effort to update and modernize its network of income tax treaties with other countries, a network that happens to be one of the most extensive in any country of the world.
At present, Canada has tax treaties in place with over 75 countries. Passage of the bill will, of course, see the number increase. The bill would enact tax treaties that Canada has signed with seven countries. Of these seven treaties, three represent updates to existing tax treaty arrangements and four of the treaties establish bilateral tax arrangements with countries for the first time.
More specifically, the treaties with Kuwait, Moldova, Mongolia and the United Arab Emirates are all new treaties that have recently been signed. They are historic in the sense that they are the first comprehensive tax treaties ever concluded with these countries.
The new treaties will provide individuals and businesses, both in Canada and in the other countries concerned, with more predictable and equitable tax results in their cross-border dealings. What is more, our arrangements with Belgium, Italy and Norway are updated to ensure that our bilateral arrangements are consistent with current Canadian tax policy.
Before discussing these treaties any further, I want to take a few minutes to provide the House with a brief overview of the importance of tax treaties and why it is necessary for the bill to be passed.
Canada taxes both the worldwide income of Canadian residents and the Canadian source income of non-residents. Put another way, all income of Canadian residents, whether earned here or abroad, is subject to a tax in Canada, whereas as non-residents are generally only taxed here to the extent that they participate in the economic life of Canada or receive income from sources in Canada.
Bilateral tax treaties or, if one prefers, income tax conventions, are an integral part of our tax system. Basically, they are arrangements signed between countries that are primarily aimed to protect taxpayers from double taxation and to assist tax authorities in their efforts to prevent fiscal evasion.
Canada benefits significantly from having tax treaties in force with other countries. Our tax treaties, for example, assure us of how Canadians will be taxed abroad. At the same time they assure our treaty partners of how their residents will be treated here in Canada.
Tax treaties also impact on the Canadian economy, particularly because they help facilitate international trade and investment by removing tax impediments to cross-border dealings. This is significant because, as hon. members know, Canada's economy relies significantly on international trade. In fact, Canadian exports account for more than 40% of our annual GDP.
What is more, Canada's economic wealth depends on direct foreign investment to Canada as well as inflows of information, capital and technology. In other words, by eliminating tax impediments and by creating more predictable tax results for traders, investors and other taxpayers with international dealings, our tax treaties promote opportunities at home and in international trade and investment abroad.
Since Canada's economy is likely to become more intertwined in the world economy, eliminating administrative difficulties and unnecessary tax impediments with respect to cross-border dealings will remain important.
I would like to point out that there can be economic disadvantages for countries and taxpayers in the absence of cooperative tax arrangements with other countries.
Let me explain. The absence of a tax treaty makes the threat of double taxation a concern to taxpayers. Double taxation occurs when a taxpayer lives in one country and earns income in another. Without a tax treaty in place to set out the tax rules, income is at risk of being taxed in both countries. This situation produces unfair results and can have adverse economic impacts.
It is only natural that investors, traders and others with international dealings want to know how they will be taxed before they commit to doing business in a given country. For example, when considering doing business in Canada, investors and traders are anxious to know the tax implications associated with their activities both in Canada and abroad. They also want assurances that they will be treated fairly.
Tax treaties establish a mutual understanding of how the tax regime of one country will interface with that of another, thus helping to remove uncertainty about the tax implications associated with doing business, working or visiting abroad.
Such an understanding can be achieved by allocating the right to tax between the two countries together with incorporating measures that resolve disputes, eliminate double taxation and require notice to be given before the arrangement can be terminated. All these measures promote certainty and stability and help produce a better business climate.
Although tax treaties, including the ones enacted in this bill, help to facilitate trade, investment and other activities between Canada and its treaty partners, they are principally aimed at achieving two main objectives. First, they aim to encourage cooperation between tax authorities in Canada and in treaty countries. One form in which cooperation takes place is through the exchange of information related to taxes. There are good grounds for including provisions in tax treaties concerning cooperation between tax administrations.
In the first place, it is desirable to give administrative assistance for the purpose of ascertaining facts as to how the rules of a particular treaty are to be applied. Moreover, in view of the increasing internationalization of economic relations, countries have a growing interest in the reciprocal supply of information.
Cooperation is also promoted through the establishment of a so-called mutual agreement procedure for resolving difficulties arising out of the application of a particular tax treaty. The mutual agreement procedure acts as a mechanism through which Canadian tax authorities and their counterparts in the other country can resolve disputes and address unintended outcomes, such as double taxation of income.
This brings me to the other fundamental objective of tax treaties, namely to prevent double taxation. Relief from double taxation is so very necessary and deserves to be discussed in some detail. Having income taxed twice when the taxpayer lives in one country and earns income in another can be troubling unless relief from double taxation is offered. As I mentioned earlier, without a tax treaty both countries could claim tax on the income without providing the taxpayer with any measures of relief for the tax paid in the other country. To alleviate the potential of this happening, a tax treaty between two countries allocates taxing authority with respect to a given item of income in one of three ways: first, the income may be taxable exclusively in the country in which it arises; second, it may be taxable only in the country in which the taxpayer is resident; or, third, it may be taxable by both the source country and the residence country, with relief from double taxation provided in some form.
The treaties contained in the bill will confer an exclusive right to tax with respect to a number of items. The other country is thereby prevented from taxing those items and double taxation is avoided. As a rule, this exclusive right to tax is conferred on the state of residence. Put another way, where a certain country is granted an exclusive right to tax, the frequency with which taxpayers of one country are burdened by the requirement to file returns and pay tax in the other country when they are not meaningful participants in the economic life of that country, or where it would be a nuisance for them to do so, is reduced.
For example, if a Canadian resident employed by a Canadian company is sent on a short term assignment, say for three months, to any one of seven treaty countries in the bill, Canada has the exclusive right to tax that person's employment income. However in the case of most items of income and capital, the right to tax is shared, although for certain types of income, such as dividends and interest, the amount of tax that may be imposed in the state of source is limited.
Under any of the seven tax treaties contained in this bill, where a shared right exists to tax an item of income of a taxpayer, there also exists an obligation on the part of the country in which the taxpayer is a resident to eliminate any double taxation.
There is another aspect of tax treaties that I want to discuss, and that is the importance of withholding taxes. The bill provides for several withholding tax rate reductions. Withholding taxes are a common feature in international taxation. In Canada's case they are levied on certain payments that Canadian residents make to non-residents. These payments include interest, dividends and royalties for example. Withholding taxes are levied on the gross amounts paid to non-residents and represent their final obligations with respect to Canadian income tax.
Without tax treaties, Canada usually taxes this income at a rate of 25% which is the rate set out under our domestic law or more precisely under the Income Tax Act. Canada's tax treaties establish limits on the amount of withholding tax that can be levied in respect of certain payments. In all cases where the maximum rates of withholding tax are set out in Canadian tax treaties they are always established at a rate lower than the 25% provided under our domestic law.
The tax treaties in the bill would all provide for certain reductions in the withholding tax rates. For example, each treaty provides for a maximum rate of withholding tax of 15% on portfolio dividends paid to non-residents. The maximum withholding tax rate for dividends paid by subsidiaries to their parent companies is reduced to a rate of 5% in all cases.
Withholding rate reductions also apply to royalty, interest and pension payments. Each treaty in the bill caps the maximum withholding tax rate on interest and royalty payments to 10%.
What is more, the treaties with Norway, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium specifically provide that no withholding tax can be levied in respect of royalty payments for the use of computer software, patents and know how.
In addition, with respect to periodic pension payments, the maximum rate of withholding tax is set at 15% for all countries except Belgium and the United Arab Emirates where no cap has been established.
These treaties also implement other measures which ensure that the tax consequences for certain transactions are in line with Canadian tax policy. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into detail about all these measures today.
In closing I want to point out that the bill is important, but albeit routine legislation. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, the bill relates to Canada's ongoing efforts to modernize and to expand its network of tax treaties with other countries. The key word here is ongoing, for Canada is already in the midst of negotiations with other countries to implement more tax treaties. I encourage all hon. members to support the bill and to pass it without delay.",Liberal,Oak Ridges,Bryon Wilfert,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=270eed77-cf5d-4c14-9ee8-2e8ad61fba99&Language=E&Section=ALL
4229135,ca.proc.d.2002-11-01.1691.3,2002-11-01,e22e31cd-045c-4450-bc5d-3e17dc6aa05d,142,"Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian Alliance)",,Government Orders,"Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2002",,"Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House to talk about Bill S-2, an act to implement tax freebies with Kuwait, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Moldova, Norway, Belgium and Italy for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.
Let me preface my remarks on the bill and the fact that the opposition will be supporting it by saying that there are some concerns the bill allows us to raise in the context of the direction we should take when it comes to taxation and the way the bill was introduced in the House.
We in the opposition always have had concerns with bills that are introduced through the Senate and then come to the House. We feel that the Senate, being unelected, lacks the legitimacy to address legislation prior to the House of Commons. More and more we find the government going that route to introduce bills relating to tax policy, and we have seen a few over the history of this government. Bills should be brought to the House so we can debate the merits first and then pass them on to the other place.
The parliamentary secretary talked about the importance of tax treaties and I would agree with him. He cited specifically that tax treaties tend to promote certainty, stability and cooperation among countries with which we engage in tax treaties. I would agree with that and so does the opposition.
However, I would take it one step further, especially as we start to enter into these forms of tax treaties. If the legislation had been introduced in the right place and had been given fair debate, Canadians and the House would have had the opportunity to compare our jurisdiction of taxes with those of other countries and see how we could create a more competitive environment to attract more business. We could also see if we were on par with other countries around the world.
It is no secret that Canada has one of the highest tax rates of industrialized nations, namely within the G-8 countries. That puts us at a great disadvantage when it comes to competing in the global economy we find ourselves in today.
I would go further than the parliamentary secretary and say that tax treaties would not only promote certainty and stability, but hopefully, by reducing overall taxes, would create a more competitive and attractive environment for businesses and people to consider Canada as a place to locate. Also, we would have a fairer tax system if we collected more taxes at home rather than the other way around. With tax rates being so high compared to those of other places, we lose our competitive disadvantage.
I would challenge the parliamentary secretary and the government to take it upon themselves to compare our tax system with those of other countries.
As was mentioned, the purpose of the bill is to ratify tax conventions agreed upon between Canada and the particular countries I mentioned. These agreements were set out to avoid double taxation between the representative nations and to establish a cooperative framework to prevent fiscal evasion. The Canadian Alliance has traditionally encouraged all measures to further equalize and liberalize foreign trade and investment. In this regard Bill S-2 is a positive measure. Nonetheless it was introduced in the Senate instead of the House of Commons.
When it comes to economic and fiscal themes, I would like to put on the record our party policy. The Canadian Alliance supports securing access to international markets through the negotiation of trade agreements. Our trade agenda would focus on diversifying both the products we sell abroad and the markets into which we sell these products. We would vigorously pursue the reduction of international trade barriers, tariffs and subsidies. We would work with international organizations that have relevant expertise to ensure the concerns of Canadians about labour practices, environmental protection and human rights are reflected.
We know that is done and reviewed on an ongoing basis, not only when it comes to tax policies, but on other facets as we engage in forming treaties and agreements with other countries. It is important that Canadians take some of our values and compare them with those around the world and share some of our experiences with countries that have challenges in some of the areas I mentioned. Hopefully we can influence some to change their ways or improve in certain areas. On the flip side, maybe we can learn from some of them.
Tax conventions, such as the ones to be implemented with Bill S-2, seek to arrange an agreement under which each government agrees to limit or modify the application of its domestic taxes to attempt to avoid double taxation. The parliamentary secretary spoke in detail about this issue.
The tax treaties that would be implemented by the bill reflect efforts to update and expand Canada's network of tax treaties so as to obtain results in conformity with current Canadian tax policy. These treaties are generally patterned on the model double taxation convention prepared by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Obviously, as the parliamentary secretary said, this is so that we do not have Canadians taxed on the same income or revenue for themselves doubly, whether in the country they currently reside in or work in and here at home.
Parts 1 to 4 of this enactment would implement tax treaties with Kuwait, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates and Moldova. Parts 5 to 7 of this enactment would implement the most recent tax treaties with Norway, Belgium and Italy. Parts 8 to 10 of this enactment would correct the English version of tax treaties with Vietnam, Portugal and Senegal which already have been enacted.
To conclude, notwithstanding the fact that the bill was introduced in the Senate, which is unelected and lacks the legitimacy to address legislation prior to the House of Commons, the Canadian Alliance will be supporting Bill S-2 as an initiative to expedite tax procedures for Canadians abroad, reduce tax evasion and focus CCRA resources on collecting taxes from Canadians living in Canada.",Canadian Alliance,Edmonton Strathcona,Rahim Jaffer,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=e22e31cd-045c-4450-bc5d-3e17dc6aa05d&Language=E&Section=ALL
4229136,ca.proc.d.2002-11-01.1691.4,2002-11-01,d3c0bcbc-2d31-4153-9833-c9601f52093e,172,"Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ)",,Government Orders,"Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2002",,"Mr. Speaker, I am caught off guard. I expected more comments, and comments in greater depth, from my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance, particularly where taxation matters are concerned, but I can say this.
We in the Bloc Quebecois have been reflecting for years now on tax conventions and tax reform. These tax conventions and the signing of numerous conventions between Canada and a number of other countries must be incorporated into the broader framework of tax reform.
I would remind hon. members that the need for federal tax reform has been debated here since the 1993 election. As part of this reform, we have also talked about ensuring that the Canadian taxation system no longer contained loopholes allowing corporations and individuals, more specifically individuals with very high incomes, to avoid paying tax, and in fact to commit out and out fraud.
Those listening have seen our emphasis since 1994, particularly on the issue of money laundering. Since that time, the former finance minister, who is also the member for LaSalle—Émard and a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada and the job of prime minister, has remained silent about our demands for taxation reform to close the loopholes and to ensure the integrity of federal public finances.
Even the Auditor General joined in with us in reminding the former finance minister and the current finance minister that everything possible had to be done to ensure the safety of the federal tax base, which has been jeopardized year after year by the government's lax attitude to tax loopholes, in particular through certain tax conventions with countries considered to be tax havens.
It is the same thing for the OECD. My colleague from the Canadian Alliance mentioned this earlier. Not only did the OECD identify problems of double taxation, but it also pointed out that there were tax treaties concluded between countries and other accords, including tax conventions, that might be detrimental to the operation of the regulatory mechanisms for liberalizing international financial markets.
About two years ago, the OECD also joined in with the Bloc Quebecois in demanding—OECD members are not members of the Bloc Quebecois, but they are as able as we are to do some good analyses—that some tax conventions signed by countries considered to be tax havens, which encourage harmful tax practices, be denounced. This is a lead in to Bill S-2.
First of all, I would like to say that we will support the bill, with the reservations I mentioned earlier about tax reform. Naturally, the corporate tax rates in Kuwait, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Moldova, Norway, Belgium and Italy are fairly similar to Canadian tax rates. Therefore, any tax convention signed with these countries to deal with the issue of double taxation makes a lot of sense.
Let me explain what a tax convention is. It is a set of rules which two countries adopt to ensure fair treatment of the business income of subsidiaries of Canadian corporations operating abroad, compared to how that income would have been treated in Canada.
The purpose is to prevent a Canadian business, with a subsidiary in the United States for example, operating in the United States and being taxed in the United States, from also being required to pay tax in Canada. It would be absurd. It would be totally unfair and it could jeopardize the profitability of Canadian businesses. Where the taxation and corporate tax rates are comparable, there is no tax equity problem. However, signing tax conventions with countries whose tax rates are not comparable to those in Canada does create a problem.
In such cases, there is a problem because it introduces a bias in the investments of Candian businesses abroad, favouring countries with low tax rates that have signed tax treaties with Canada.
We have condemned this situation for years now. There were, and there still are, certain tax treaties signed between Canada and the United States that have no justification, that are flagrant injustices and that bias Canadian investors' decisions abroad.
The vast majority of tax treaties are fine, because Canadian taxation rates and those of these other countries are relatively comparable. So, taxing and returning revenue from Canadian businesses abroad poses no problems in terms of fairness when compared to Canadian businesses operating in Canada.
However, if we take the example of Barbados, where the tax rates hover around 1.5% for corporate profits and capital gains, and compare it to our rate of 28% or 29%, it becomes clear that there is a flagrant imbalance.
It becomes clear that there is a bias at work that favours Canadian investment in Barbados. The tax treaty between Canada and Barbados creates both direct and indirect investment in Barbados. This is not a simple bias.
There is a total of $257 billion of direct Canadian investment abroad, approximately. Of this amount, Barbados ranks third in terms of Canadian investment abroad, with $16.8 billion in direct Canadian investment; that is more direct Canadian investment than Japan, France and Mexico combined.
When a little country such as Barbados, with 270,000 residents, ranks third in terms of direct Canadian investments abroad, it begs the question: why? We are not the only ones asking this question. The former Auditor General, Mr. Desautels, asked this question for years. The OECD has also asked why. Specifically, its Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, the FATF, has asked the same type of question that we have been asking for years.
What is it that promotes this bias? The tax treaty between Canada and Barbados. We need to look more closely into this type of situation. We have been asking the Minister of Finance and the government to reassess tax treaties, particularly those signed with countries that are considered tax havens for good reason. We have done so because we must ensure that when we talk about the free market, when we talk about the movement of funds, when we talk about direct and indirect Canadian investments abroad, we have to see what produces these biases, problems and barriers for these investments.
In the case of Barbados, there are no barriers; indeed, it is the exact opposite. We are encouraging Canadian investment in Barbados, which is considered to be the number one tax haven, where the tax rate is incredibly low, if not non-existent in some cases, compared to corporate taxes in Canada. We are promoting cashflow out of Canada to Barbados. We find it fair that corporate profits are taxed at 1.5% and returned to Canada, where Canadian businesses operating on Canadian soil have to pay 28%. It just does not work. It makes absolutely no sense.
How can we encourage this type of system? Even the FATF, the OECD group, compiles a list of countries considered to be tax havens and also considered to have taxation practices that are harmful to all of the world. For three of the four years that the FATF, this OECD group, has published the names of the countries at fault, Barbados has always been on the list. There are others, but Barbados has always been on the list.
Others have made improvements with regard to bank secrecy. It is no longer as strict as it used to be in several countries that previously were adamant about it, regardless of who the investors or depositors were. A degree of flexibility has been introduced first to ensure that the money laundering networks of international criminal groups and terrorist groups do not benefit from tax conventions or from these countries being recognized by the United Nations organization.
Second, some tax practices, although above board, hurt others because they introduce a great deal of bias or distortion due to the imbalance in tax rates. Such practices must be rectified. Barbados has never had to make such corrections, and yet we still have a tax convention with that country, which hurts direct foreign investment. It would appear the government sees nothing wrong with this kind of tax convention.
As I said earlier, we are not opposed to tax conventions. They are a logical thing. We cannot have double taxation because it would be damaging to Canadian companies doing business abroad. But this does not mean we should sign tax conventions with countries considered to be tax havens with damaging practices, especially countries such as Barbados which, like the OECD, we have been condemning since 1994. This does not make sense. As if it were not bad enough that we have a tax convention with Barbados, the federal government is promoting this tax haven on its website. This leaves some of my colleagues completely speechless. I invite them to visit the web site of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. They will find a rather romantic description of tax havens, particularly Barbados, and ways to avoid paying federal taxes by investing money abroad in what is called the offshore financial sector.
On the Foreign Affairs and International Trade website, in the brochure entitled “Barbados: A Guide for Canadian Exporters”, we read, and I quote:

The offshore financial sector—

—referring to tax evasion in tax havens—

continues to grow and is becoming increasingly important to the economy as a source of foreign exchange and employment. The Canadian business community and banking sector is especially active in Barbados.

By the way, the five major Canadian banks have a total of 50 branches in Barbados. I have been asking the Canadian Bankers Association since 1993 what they are doing with 50 branches in Barbados. I have been asking where their revenues come from, what their activities are, and whether they are not at risk of having a fast one pulled on them, say by being involuntarily involved in money laundering by organized crime groups, drug traffickers in particular, and terrorist groups. Since 1993, I have not managed to get an answer.
I continue quoting from the document posted on the Foreign Affairs and International Trade website:

A Double Taxation Treaty exists with Canada—

This is a tax treaty like the ones brought before us this morning through Bill S-2. I continue:

—and the two Governments have recently signed a Foreign Investment Protection Agreement.Tax treaties with Canada and the United States have been important to the development of this industry.

We are talking about offshore banking here.
And yet we have across the way a government that will come after any of us if we owe the taxman so much as a penny. The Canadian tax system literally hunts down anyone who owes it $10. It is merciless. Taxpayers must pay up.
If we owe $100, we must pay $100, or they will come after us. We face penalties, are charged interest, hunted down. However, the same government promotes foreign investments in countries that are considered to be tax havens, countries like Barbados that the OECD condemned for having tax practices detrimental to countries with regular tax systems.
The federal government promotes investments in such countries but, at the same time, it tells Canadian taxpayers that they must pay every penny that they owe in taxes. This is a rather strange way of doing things. It is shameful on the part of a government to tax people to death and to even talk about adding another tax to fund health care, when federal surpluses have totalled several billions of dollars over the past three years. The government is talking about adding a new tax to fund health care while promoting tax avoidance for Canada's richest taxpayers, through countries such as Barbados.
Is it not bad enough to ask us to tighten our belt, to keep paying over and over and, at the same time, to use federal websites for propaganda encouraging the rich not to pay taxes here, but instead to safely invest their millions and billions elsewhere? I remind those who are listening to us that Barbados is the third most popular destination abroad for direct investments by Canadians. This tax scheme encourages wealthy Canadians to avoid paying taxes to the federal government.
This raises ethical issues. I mentioned federal websites, but there is also CanadExport , a publication of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade which promotes international trade, provides progress reports on that activity, includes news on the financial sector for goods and services, and so on.
In an article recently published in CanadExport , it was mentioned that the government wanted to “demystify tax havens”. Again, this is a publication from the federal government which, on the one hand, tells us that we must pay all our taxes and, on the other hand, promotes tax havens for Canada's richest taxpayers, so that they do not have to pay their due to Revenue Canada.
It does not make sense to ask those of us who stay in the country to foot the whole tax bill. It does not make sense to cut employment benefits again and again as has happened since 1995, to reduce health and education transfers and ask us to further tighten our belt because the government cannot afford to do more. On the other hand, however, the government encourages wealthy taxpayers to take their money out of Canada to avoid paying income tax to Revenue Canada. I wonder if Canadians realize or can figure out how much those rich taxpayers save in income tax by investing in Barbados, for example. Do they realize that these businesses can also save money through direct investments in Barbados and other countries considered to be tax havens? Are people aware that this money which is not coming into the federal coffers means that the federal government will have that much less to spend on health, education or the fight against poverty?
We would not need new taxes, as proposed by senators in the other place. They are talking about a special $5 billion tax. If the federal government did not encourage people to invest their money abroad to avoid income tax, it would have enough money in its coffers to provide adequate funding for health, education and social assistance. This is absolutely clear.
How can the government pawn such nonsense and inequities off on us? How can there be two classes of citizens in this country? One which is crushed by income tax and poverty and the other which is spared taxes and is encouraged by the federal government, through numerous brochures and its website, to invest its money abroad?
The brilliant analyses of senior Department of Finance officials also facilitates this. “Want to know how to invest in Barbados? To save tax money? No problem. We will explain the whole tax haven situation. Want to jeopardize the entire federal tax base? No problem. We, federal public servants that we are, will help you invest your millions, even billions, of dollars in other countries so as to jeopardize the entire federal tax base”.
The Auditor General has been speaking out against these practices for years. The Auditor General has also criticized the lack of specialized staff at the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and the Department of Finance to keep an eye on these tax conventions and the exodus of rich Canadians' assets to other countries. There is no control over this.
Hon. members will recall the transfer to the United States, several years ago, of two family trusts worth over $2 billion. This wealthy Canadian family was told it could make this transfer without paying any taxes to Canada. Remember?
There have certainly been other similar instances. There have probably been a number of cases of preferential treatment for wealthy taxpayers. There is something called a Department of Finance advance ruling that enables the wealthy to seek the opinion of senior departmental officials and then to invest, or carry out certain other operations, in another country without paying a cent of income tax.
There have likely been dozens of such instances of federal taxes evasion resulting in lost federal revenues, and thus the slashes to federal contributions to health and education carried out by the former Minister of Finance, the hon. member for LaSalle—Émard, and Prime Ministerial hopeful. These cuts might have been a little less drastic if his wealthy friends had paid what they should have to Revenue Canada.
While we are on the subject of the transfer of those family trusts worth $2 billion, is there anyone at the Department of Finance or the CCRA who can tell me what has become of them? The ten year term for these family trusts ended last year, I believe. Up until last year, the trustees did not have the right to cash in their trusts, in other words, sell their assets for profit, without paying tax to the CCRA, even if they were in the United States.
Is there currently any sufficiently specialized public official who has followed these two family trusts that were transferred to the United States and who could tell me if the trustees sold off their assets for a profit? Is it possible to find out if the trustee sold these assets off last year, after the deadline, or before the date that allowed the CCRA to collect its share of the capital in the form of taxes? Can anyone provide this information?
No, there is no such person. Do hon. members know why? Because, as the Auditor General has pointed out for years now, there is a lack of specialized resources at the Department of Finance and the CCRA to track the movement of capital from Canadian investors.
We no longer have enough specialists to properly manage the countless tax treaties and advance rulings handed down by senior officials when it comes to the investment of Canadian capital abroad.
I will conclude on the other aspect of the issue. Since 1994, we have been asking the Minister of Finance and the government to review these tax treaties and any practices that could be harmful in terms of the flight of Canadian capital abroad. The government keeps turning a deaf ear.
On occasion, as I asked questions to the former Minister of Finance and member for LaSalle—Émard, who wants to become the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister to boot, about the fact that he was not taking any action on tax reform or on the termination of certain tax treaties, I could not help but wonder if he was not both judge and defendant in such instances and if it will not be even worse when he is the Prime Minister.
The former Minister of Finance and member for LaSalle—Émard also owns a shipping company that operates in waters bordering countries recognized as tax havens, like Barbados. I think that it would be very difficult for someone wanting to become the Prime Minister, let alone once he has become the Prime Minister, not to respond to our criticism of the tax treaty between Canada and Barbados, which the OECD also condemns.
Will the next Prime Minister have more courage than the former Minister of Finance, even if he has interests in boundary waters in the Caribbean, in Barbados in particular? Will he have the courage to terminate the tax treaty between Canada and Barbados? Will the future Prime Minister and member for LaSalle—Émard stop looking out for his own personal interests and start looking out for those of all taxpayers in Canada and Quebec instead?
Can we get from this future Prime Minister the formal commitment that he will not consider the expansion of Canada Steamship Lines as the fundamental basis for his decisions as Prime Minister, but that he will consider the interests of all taxpayers? Concerning tax conventions that impact negatively on the federal tax base, that are a source of inequity for the other taxpayers who pay huge amounts in taxes every year and who are tracked down, as if they were thieves, when they owe as little as a single cent to Revenue Canada, he has to rectify the situation and to listen very carefully. We hope that he will do so even though he has remained silent for several years about our demands to denounce tax conventions, such as the one with Barbados, which impact negatively on the federal tax base.
We will see what happens, but I hope that the future Prime Minister will listen more carefully, will have a better sense of equity and justice and will not consider merely his personal benefits, but also those of taxpayers in general when he decides to maintain or abolish these conventions.",Bloc Québécois,Saint-Hyacinthe--Bagot,Yvan Loubier,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d3c0bcbc-2d31-4153-9833-c9601f52093e&Language=E&Section=ALL

My bill could actually be called the freedom from double taxation bill because we all have to pay income tax on money that we then subsequently use to pay our property taxes.

Madam Speaker, the title of the bill hardly says what it is about, but it has to do with dates. Since we have moved into the years 2000, dates have become very confusing. For example, what does 4/2/3 mean as it pertains to a date? Is that 4 February, 2003? Is it April 2, 2003? Is it 2004, February 3? Is it 2004, 2 March?

Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.)",,Routine Proceedings,Question No. 18,,"With regard to specific treaties being made between the crown and aboriginal bands or communities in the Maritimes, the British crown signed a number of historical documents with the Mi’kmaq, Maliseet and Passamaquoddy people between 1725 and 1779. These historical documents are commonly referred to as treaties, but only three of them, the two LaHeve treaties of 1760-61 and the Cope treaty of 1752, have been formally recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada as having the constitutional status of treaties.
In response to part (a) of the question, it is important to consider the geographical boundaries and political structures of the Maritimes in the 1700s. In the Marshall decision, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that “...the British signed a series of agreements with individual Mi’kmaq communities in 1760 and 1761 intending to have them consolidated into a comprehensive Mi’kmaq treaty that was never in fact brought into existence. The trial judge found that by the end of 1761 all of the Mi’kmaq villages in Nova Scotia had entered into separate but similar treaties”. It is important to note that during the colonial period, Nova Scotia was considered to include modern day New Brunswick.
Regarding parts (b) and (c) as they relate to the Supreme Court of Canada decision on Marshall, only the 1760-61 treaties were recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada as treaties under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The 1760 LaHeve treaty was signed on March 10, 1760 in Halifax. The 1761 LaHeve treaty was signed on November 9, 1761 in Halifax.
In addition, the other “historical documents” that have been identified from various archival sources are virtually identical to the LaHeve treaty of 1760 with the exception of the February 23, 1760 agreement with the Saint John (Maliseet) and Passamaquoddy Indians, which contained similar promises but also renewed previous peace and friendship treaties with the crown.
Copies of the following 1760-61 documents were provided to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in May 2001:
Renewal of 1725 Articles and 1749 Articles, with the delegates of the Saint John and Passamaquoddy, at Chebucto (Halifax) Harbour, 23 February 1760; Treaty dated 10 March 1760 with Chief Michael Augustine of the Richebuctou Tribe; Treaty with Chief Paul of LaHeve Tribe at Halifax, 10 March 1760; Treaty with Claude René, Chief of Chibennacadie and Muscadoboit, concluded at Halifax, 10 March 1760; Treaty with the Merimichi Tribe, concluded 25 June 1761; Treaty with Chief Claude Atouash of the Jedaick Tribe, concluded at Halifax, 25 June 1761; Treaty with Etiene Apshobon of the Pogmouch Tribe, Halifax, 25 June 1761; Treaty with Joseph Argimaut, Chief of Mesiguash Indians, Halifax, 8 July 1761; Treaty with Chief Jeannot Picklougawash on behalf of the Pictouk and Malegomich Tribes, 12 October 1761; and Treaty with Chief Francis Mius of the LaHeve Tribe, concluded at Halifax, 9 November 1761.
In part (d) reference is made to “Marshall or Halifax treaties”. It is assumed this is in reference to the LaHeve treaties of 1760-61, which were considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Marshall decision. Therefore, with respect to which bands or communities are covered by these treaties, the Government of Canada is of the view that while modern day first nations are the most likely successor groups of the original signatory groups, it is impossible to determine a direct correlation between the application of treaties to modern day first nations.
It is important to keep in mind that the passage of time has meant that there have been changes to the composition of some of the signatory groups. We recognize the difficulty in connecting the signatories of historic treaties to particular contemporary first nation communities. This may be due in part to migration of first nations, intermarriage, government policies creating bands and other initiatives such as the centralization of reserves. However, since the court found that all Mi’kmaq communities participated in the treaties, members of modern communities are likely beneficiaries of these treaty rights.
For these reasons, the Government of Canada has determined that the most appropriate course of action is to enter into a dialogue with the 34 Mi’kmaq and Maliseet first nations in present day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec to consider the implications of the Marshall decision.
Parts (e) and (f) of the question are unanswerable since only the two LaHeve treaties of 1760-61 and the Cope treaty of 1752 have been formally recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada as having the constitutional status of treaties. In addition, the Government of Canada maintains that while modern day first nations are the most likely successor groups to the original collectives that signed the treaties, it is impossible to determine a direct correlation between the application of treaties to contemporary first nations. As for which bands are not covered by treaties, part (g), the question is unanswerable due to changes in the composition of some of the signatory groups over the years. Nonetheless, the Government of Canada has drawn from the observations of the Supreme Court of Canada in its decision on Marshall and has determined that working with the 34 Mi’kmaq and Maliseet first nations on the implications of this decision is the most appropriate course of action.",Liberal,Kenora--Rainy River,Bob Nault,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=72e2a81c-f40c-4c0f-8be0-09a9e61254c3&Language=E&Section=ALL

The NDP will have no trouble voting for Bill S-2. We recognize there are seven tax treaties that are designed and speak to the issue of fairness, and try to minimize the duplication of taxation for Canadian citizens working abroad. The reciprocity would exist for others who are signatory to that treaty to have the same fairness and rights were they working in this country.
We recognize that it is necessary for cooperation between this country and our trading partners. We believe that tax treaties enhance the trading relationships that we have with other countries around the world. We recognize the benefit that treaties like this have in giving opportunities to share information between the two countries, for example, administrative information that can aid, assist and benefit the relationship that exists between these very countries. We recognize the need for us to deal with the issue of double taxation.
We would hope that our government would take steps to minimize the risk of such a thing happening to Canadian people working abroad. We would point out though that there are a number of ways that the treaty could have been crafted to deal with the issue of double taxation. We do not know who has the exclusive authority, and perhaps this will become clear as the bill moves further along, regarding double taxation, for example, exclusive to the source country, or exclusive to the country of residence of a person being taxed or some combination of the two. One of the points that has come to our attention is that there is a lack of clarity on that issue as it tries to deal with the issue of double taxation.
The other point of note, as the parliamentary secretary who introduced the bill pointed out, the withholding tax rates are of some concern to those involved. We are satisfied that Bill S-2 would address the issue that interest, dividends and royalties that are subject to withholding taxes would be taxed at a rate which used to be 25% and would now be reduced to about 5% in some countries to a high of 15%. This is a general reduction of taxes for those who are having funds withheld due to interests, dividends or royalties. That may have an effect on Canadian artists and musicians who have royalty cheques coming from other places. The tax rate would be harmonized now at a rate lower than they are being taxed currently. We would see that as mildly beneficial to some Canadians and therefore we would be pleased to support it.
I would like to thank the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois for expanding the debate somewhat, because I think it is an opportunity for us to speak to the larger picture of the treatment of taxation when we are dealing with international trading relationships. He spent much of his speech pointing out that we must be careful that we are not enhancing tax havens, in other words disadvantaging our own country by unduly promoting tax situations in other countries which may in fact be detrimental to our own revenue streams here in this country.
He used the example of Barbados as a popular Canadian tax haven and he pointed out that the Government of Canada's own website was offering offshore investment opportunities as an idea for minimizing a person's taxes. It strikes me as strange that the Government of Canada would do anything to enhance and promote people's tax avoidance by putting money offshore.
I was pleased he raised that, because even though today we are dealing with a tax treaty that deals with seven tax treaties, I believe, with countries like Kuwait, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Moldova, Norway, Belgium and Italy, we can have a much larger debate about the treatment of tax havens and certainly the government's unwillingness to protect revenue that rightfully belongs in Canada and should be spent in Canada.
Again, we have pointed out the contradiction that we have revenue shortages and program cutbacks that need an injection of revenue. We are even contemplating the possibility of raising taxes to meet those needs, yet we are willingly letting revenue slip out of the country and, if the hon. member is correct, even promoting money slipping out of the country which should rightfully be going to programs.
I would like to draw attention to one case that I have quite a lot of personal knowledge of, that is, the tax avoidance of the Bronfman family. I will use the name even though during the court cases the name of the family was not used. Ten years plus a few months ago, the Bronfman family transferred billions of dollars in family trusts out of the country and got special dispensation not to pay any capital gains tax on those billions of dollars. Had the Bronfmans paid an ordinary rate of capital gains on that money, it would have been $750 million of revenue for the Government of Canada. The statute of limitations on this kind of thing is 10 years. In the ninth year, when people in the general public became aware that it was the Mulroney government that allowed this transfer of Canadian funds out of the country without any capital gains being paid on it, they tried to intervene in the courts. They called it “operation loophole”.
The reason I have some personal knowledge of it is that a constituent of mine is the person who appealed to the Federal Court for the right to intervene on behalf of Canadian taxpayers to encourage Revenue Canada to enforce the law for the benefit of all of us and to charge the taxes that were owing to the country. His name is George Harris. I think he is a Canadian hero. For two years he fought tooth and nail and made an enormous personal sacrifice in terms of time and resources to go through all the stages of Federal Court and was blocked every step of the way. The Government of Canada tried to stop him from filing that appeal.
The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada because the case was won at the various preliminary stages. It went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the request that the Government of Canada enforce its own revenue laws. Ultimately the case was lost in the highest court of the land. The Bronfman family got away with it and Canada lost $750 million worth of revenue.
We had members of the Canadian Health Coalition come before the finance committee stating what they thought the needs were for the health care system for this year alone. They were not blue-skying it. They say that $1.1 billion is required immediately to plug some of the gaping holes, whereas the government willingly let $750 million worth of revenue go out of the country. If you or I, Madam Speaker, owed $100 in taxes we would be hounded to the ends of the earth. The government would be knocking down our doors to collect that. It would be repossessing our property to collect that. However, it willingly let $750 million of revenue go. I am very critical of that. It is relevant. I do not know if I am going to be challenged on relevancy in this speech, but it does have to do with taxation policy and international foreign relationships, I suppose, with other countries.
I am really quite impressed with how thorough and how comprehensive Bill S-2 is. It really seems as though it tries to consider every eventuality and is very careful to anticipate all the possibilities of Canadians working abroad and whether they file taxes in their home country or in the country that is the source of the revenue. All the combinations, permutations and possibilities were considered, yet the contrast I would like to point out is that there are other aspects of taxation law where there seems to be a complete unwillingness to even lift a finger to correct obvious flaws in the Income Tax Act. I would like to draw attention to just one and that is the fact that businesses can deduct fines as legitimate tax deductions.
I simply cannot believe that it was ever Parliament's intention when it crafted the Income Tax Act to make it tax deductible to break the law. I do not accept that, but we have made government aware that this is the perhaps inadvertent status quo or byproduct of the current act and it has chosen not to take any steps to correct it. It has known for years that this is the situation, so I am confused by the amount of detail and analysis that it spent on Bill S-2, which does not affect that many people, really, although it will be of benefit to some Canadians working abroad. I am confused by its complete unwillingness to address this outrageous tax loophole that exists whereby fines and penalties can be considered a legitimate, tax deductible business expense.
The government will not dedicate one iota of time and resources to add one simple line to the Income Tax Act, which could say that “for greater clarity, fines and penalties imposed by law are not to be considered tax deductible expenses”. The situation would be resolved. In the absence of the government taking that action one can only conclude that it approves of the current situation, which most Canadians certainly would not.
The other thing I would point out in terms of contrast to the amount of energy and attention that the government attributes to some things is the disability tax credit. There was an absolute missionary zeal with which it undertook harassing every disabled person in the country who applies for and qualifies for the disability tax credit. It spared no effort in terms of energy or resources to go to every single person who applied for the disability tax credit and make them undergo a whole new medical test at their own expense and then reapply and requalify under a rigid new set of criteria. It raised the bar a great deal in regard to who should be eligible for the paltry $970 disability tax credit.
We can imagine the energy and the resources it must have taken to review every one of those applicant and recipient files, craft a letter and send it out. I believe the current estimate is about $7 a letter. That is what it costs to mail a letter these days by the time it is produced, printed and mailed to the public. Then each one of those people who wanted to reapply for the disability tax credit was forced to go and get a new medical opinion at their own expense. Doctors do not do that for free because it is not covered under the medical plan. It costs from $130 to $150 to prove that a visually impaired person is still unable to see or to prove that an amputee is still an amputee or to prove that for quadriplegics nothing miraculous happened overnight to change their circumstances between when they filed for their disability tax credit last year and now wish to file again. This small amount of money is supposed to compensate people for the extra expenses they incur due to their disability, so it is frankly the most meanspirited and cynical initiative that I have witnessed since I have been here in Ottawa.
I raise it because it stands in such glaring contrast to how the government shows a wilful blindness to an obvious tax loophole that could be plugged, thereby forgoing revenue as a result by allowing a tax deduction that should not be allowed. On the other hand, the government wastes all kinds of energy and resources in harassing, of all people, the disabled. It is a glaring contrast that we should shine the spotlight on.
Bill S-2 does not offend me. I can see it being necessary and even useful. What irritates Canadians, I believe, are the other contradictions in taxation policy in the country and the warped sense of priorities that exists when one considers the disability tax credit, operation loophole, and allowing businesses to deduct fines, to reward people, let us say, for breaking the law. I do not think there can be a person here who does not recognize that it undermines the deterrent value of a fine if we can have it reduced automatically by writing it off against our income taxes. That much is common sense.
If Bill S-2 is worthy of our attention in such great detail, I wish that Revenue Canada would spend more time and attention on glaring, outrageous omissions like the business tax deduction for fines.",New Democratic Party,Winnipeg Centre,Pat Martin,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=4ac38ab4-c480-4dde-8f12-a80ff2b4f215&Language=E&Section=ALL
4229275,ca.proc.d.2002-11-01.1691.143,2002-11-01,6025d38f-3695-4037-8221-3f4cb652936b,58,"Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC)",,Government Orders,"Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2002",,"Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill S-2. The previous speaker brought up the subject of the disability tax credit and I am glad he did. I had not thought to raise that issue in my remarks, but I will do that now. I have raised the issue in the House several times and I have been very troubled with the way in which some of my specific constituents have been dealt with.
Last night the Minister of National Revenue spent a long time helping me go through the system. I very much appreciate her taking the time to do that. I am still just as concerned as I was before, but I have a much better understanding of the process. She was very good to have spent the time with my staff and me to help us understand why this review happened, why the changes are there and what the philosophy is behind them. I would like to extend my appreciation to the minister for that.
In those discussions last night I talked about two people in my riding who had been receiving the disability tax credit for some time and then had it cancelled. One is Don Pryor, a man who was run over by a train. His leg was amputated and his internal organs were damaged. He has gone through a great deal of grief and pain since I think 1979. He was receiving the disability tax credit and then with this new review, it was taken away after all that time.
Obviously he still does not have his leg and suffers from all the injuries, but he has been denied his tax credit. We will to appeal it once again, as the minister instructed, and hopefully we will have it reinstated. That is an example of the shock that hits people on this issue.
Again, I want to thank the minister for taking the time last night to help me with this. I really do appreciate it. It was very helpful. Perhaps if we all had access to that, we could understand what is happening and we could help people with disabilities through this very troubling program.
My staff and I came away from that meeting much more informed and better prepared to help because we all care about disabled people. We all have them in our ridings. They are all coming to our doors with these situations. It is much more than just a review to them. It is almost intimidation by big government. They are afraid in some cases to even fill out the form and return it. They go to their doctors and the doctors are sometimes not cooperative. The forms that are filled out are supposed to be free but now some doctors find it necessary to charge for them. There are a lot of questions and it is very complicated for people with disabilities.
I never had a lot to do with people with disabilities until I came to Parliament. Now it is very much a part of my job because of the hurdles thrown in the paths of people with disabilities at every turn. Whether it is a disabled person applying for Canada pension or simply trying to find ways to afford to put a ramp into a house or to change the facilities in a house or receiving the disability tax credit, it is very complicated for that person.
In my view it results in many cases with people with physical disabilities ending up with very troubled emotional situations because they have lost their ability to contribute in some cases. They have lost their ability to support their families in some cases. What starts off as an emotional disability ends up as a financial disability because they cannot work, they cannot earn a living like they used to, they cannot join the workforce and the hope for promotions and recognition for the good jobs they have done is gone.
When someone is totally disabled, it has a big impact on them, much more than just a physical disability. I have learned to appreciate that from meeting some of the people with disabilities. I admire them for handling their situations.
I have a letter from a Mr. Sherman Bent. This man is incredible. He was a hard worker all of his life. He never had a day off in his entire life until he was diagnosed with a very serious cancer. He went through a full year of chemotherapy, which did not work. Then he had to go through a bone marrow transplant. That left him without 80% of his vision in one eye and 50% in the other. He is pretty much confined to a wheelchair. He requires help to do everything in his normal life that people without disabilities can do and not even think about it.
He applied for the disability tax credit some time ago and received it. Then this year he has been denied it even though he is totally disabled. As instructed by the minister, I will help Mr. Sherman Bent appeal this. I believe by any standards he should receive it and I will stay with it until he does. It is a big issue for all of us.
I would say that perhaps the case was not handled the way it should have been. Considering how serious it is to these people, perhaps we should all go back, take a look at this and try to learn more about it, which is what I did last night. It will change how we handle it.
I will move on to the subject at hand, which is what I am supposed to be talking about, Bill S-2. It just makes common sense to enter into treaties with other countries so that we can share information and make sure there is not double taxation. This came very close to home for me a couple of years ago.
Before a friend of mine moved to Bermuda he got all the rules and regulations from the tax department. As he was told by the tax department, he sold his house and completely transferred his whole life to Bermuda. He had a three year contract and is a professional. He did everything he could to avoid double taxation. He followed the rules exactly.
What happened was that a situation happened in his family. He thought it would be better if he came back to Canada before his three year contract was up. Of course that triggered a nightmare from the tax department because Bermuda charged him tax and Canada charged him tax. He had gone through this whole thing for nothing. He had sold his house and had taken all the steps that the tax department told him to, but because his circumstances changed it placed a great burden on him. It took a long time for him to sort it out.
I understand what double taxation can do. This was a Canadian who had gone to Bermuda to do a professional job. He ended up being audited by Revenue Canada when he came back and it determined that he owed a lot of tax money on which he already had paid tax in Bermuda. Again he had gone through the painful ordeal of selling his house, moving his family and completely uprooting himself exactly according to the instructions.
It can be very troubling when someone from another country comes to Canada or someone from Canada goes to another country and has to face this double taxation. This convention will help eliminate that.
The convention would actually ratify treaties with Kuwait, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates and Moldova, but it would also correct treaties with Norway, Belgium and Italy, and some technical aspects of the treaties with Vietnam, Portugal and Senegal. It now means that Canada has negotiated tax treaties with 80 countries so that if Canadians do move to another country they will at least have a chance under these treaties not to be double taxed .
Unfortunately, every country has a different regime for taxation. Some have capital gains and some do not. Some have income tax and some do not, and so on, but at least now they will have some protection against double taxation. It should also facilitate investment from country to country, which is necessary for us all to grow and get the maximum benefit from the global economy.
The second purpose of the bill is to avoid tax evasion by people who go from country to country and try to break the rules. All of us as members of Parliament know that if the government establishes a set of rules, it does not matter whether it is a disability tax credit or fisheries, there are always some people who try to get around the rules. By previously allowing people to go from one country to another, and there was no sharing of information, the people who wanted to break the rules and take advantage of loopholes were able to do so. Perhaps this will avoid those infractions of our taxation rules. Perhaps it will ensure that Revenue Canada gets the taxation revenue to which it is entitled.
I will be supporting the bill. It is a timely bill and it would increase our participation in the global economy. It would make it easier for Canadians to participate and exercise their rights to travel and work in other countries.",Progressive Conservative,Cumberland--Colchester,Bill Casey,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=6025d38f-3695-4037-8221-3f4cb652936b&Language=E&Section=ALL
