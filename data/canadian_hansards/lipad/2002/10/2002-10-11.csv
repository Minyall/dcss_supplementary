4226508,ca.proc.d.2002-10-11.1681.1,2002-10-11,c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c,186,"Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance)",,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,"Mr. Speaker, as I said in the first five minutes of my reply to the Speech from the Throne, if the Prime Minister wants to have a true legacy he has 16 months in order to act for the public good and to implement changes for the public good that will dramatically improve the lives of Canadians. I have spoken before on health care with regard to amending and modernizing the Canada Health Act, implementing a plan for a manpower strategy for nurses, doctors and technicians and also a plan I proferred the last time I spoke which would enable those people to be redistributed to rural areas to work.
On the issue of economics, if the Prime Minister truly wants to affect the poor the objective is not to throw money at the situation but to give them the tools to do the job. Certainly there are many individuals who cannot work for various reasons and those people need to be taken care of. That is the purpose of social programs. What we need to do is give people the tools so they are able to work and provide for themselves.
One thing the Prime Minister could do is raise the basic minimum people have to pay taxes on to $18,000 a year. No one in the country who is making less than $18,000 a year should be paying any tax. A person can barely survive on that.
On the issue of drugs in health care, what the Prime Minister ought to do is implement a strategy that works to prevent drug use and criminal use and also gets tough with those parasites in our society, particularly organized crime gangs, who are involved in drug trafficking, prostitution and money laundering. They are preying upon our society, using our weak laws that enable them to do it.
On the issue of foreign policy, the Prime Minister said he wants to have an African agenda. He has said some very nice words but has not backed them up with facts. He has not acted on Zimbabwe. He has not mentioned a word on the crisis in Zimbabwe, where half the population of that country, six million people, is going to die in the next six months unless the international community mobilizes against President Mugabe. Although this is not about land reform at all, President Mugabe is using the land reform issue and racial politics as a shield to hide his true objective, which is to brutalize the black population. Ninety-nine and a half per cent of the people in Zimbabwe are black and he is going to kill six million of them by depriving them of food in a politically engineered famine over the next six months. This is not on anyone's radar screen.
Another seven million are going to die in politically engineered famines in five other countries. In Angola we have a narrow window of opportunity to help that country in a multilateral effort to engage with President dos Santos and use the billions of dollars in oil money for health and education, de-mining and infrastructure. This would go a long way toward saving that country. If we do not engage in Angola in the next six months as an international community, that country will become a failed state like Somalia. The country will fracture and we will never, ever be able to pick that up again.
On the issue of AIDS, 30% and sometimes up to 50% of the population in some countries is HIV positive. This is going to wipe out half the population of some countries. The economic backbone of these countries will wither away. The Prime Minister feels that the answer is to throw money at the situation. The irony of the continent is that it is an extraordinarily rich continent. It has incredible resources in diamonds, minerals, coltan, hydro power, agriculture and timber. It has incredible resources and yet it has the poorest people on the planet.
Throwing money at the situation is not the same as having an effect. What we need to do is implement policies that are going to affect people and deal with the three major issues that are affecting the development of that continent: corruption and lack of governance; conflict; and a lack of capacitance in primary health and education, as well as of course AIDS. Affect those three, work with the resources on the continent, enable capacitance to take place, defeat corruption and have good governance, and our country would have a foreign policy that truly would be an African agenda which the Prime Minister could be proud of and would affect the lives of these people.",Canadian Alliance,Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca,Keith Martin,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c&Language=E&Section=ALL
4226509,ca.proc.d.2002-10-11.1681.2,2002-10-11,bb250ed1-5b30-460d-9e85-a2006f2dbf47,4630,"Mr. Steve Mahoney (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.)",,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity this morning to talk a little about some of the initiatives in the throne speech.
It is interesting for us to follow the speeches that occur after a throne speech. Frankly, they tend to be rather general, and often somewhat negative when coming from the opposition, which is understandable. In fact, a throne speech is really about vision. It is about the vision that the government has. Some may not share that vision. Members opposite or members of the media or some Canadians may not share that vision, but clearly that is what it is.
There are a number of key points announced in the throne speech that I think deserve some analysis and some discussion. It would be interesting if we could ever do it without the partisan flavour, but I doubt that is possible, frankly.
The first point in the throne speech states that we will put in place a health care system to meet the needs of Canadians today and in the future. I think we all know that the number one issue for all Canadians is our health care system. We are also well aware that Roy Romanow is in the late stages of his cross-Canada study and will be releasing a report with recommendations.
I believe most Canadians have faith in Mr. Romanow. He actually, as we all know, comes from the seat of medicare, the province of Tommy Douglas, and I always like to give credit where it is due, of the New Democratic Party and the CCF, its forerunner, who started public medicare. They sure did. As a result of that effort, all Canadians I think appreciate the fact that Mr. Romanow is doing a very thorough analysis on the health care system.
The reality of the health care system is that when it started it was indeed fifty-fifty between the provinces and the federal government. However, what was covered in that fifty-fifty agreement was fundamentally physicians and hospitals. Since that time, provincial jurisdictions, which is their right as they are duly and democratically elected to represent their provinces, have expanded the coverage of medicare to go well beyond the initial agreement of providing fifty-fifty funding for physicians and hospitals. I do not dispute if they want to put certain services in Ontario or in Alberta. They have every right to do that. They are answerable to their constituents. That is one of the strengths of the federation of Canada.
However, it would not make sense to me that a provincial government could simply announce to its community that it is going to add certain things to the envelope of health care and then just expect that the federal government, regardless of who is in office, will agree and will again split the cost fifty-fifty. That is why the Romanow commission, in my view, will be examining the services that are provided under health care. It will be examining the ways in which health care is delivered. It will be examining, I hope, such things as people who are in beds in hospitals when perhaps they should be in beds in long term care or acute care facilities. They should not be taking up space in a hospital, which means that when the emergency room floods, when all of the people come in during peak hours in an emergency room, there are no beds for those people so they wind up on stretchers in the hall. Do we build hospitals with the capacity to run at peak in an emergency room setting 24 hours a day? I do not think anyone thinks that is necessarily the efficient way of delivering hospital care. As well, at the same time that many provincial governments have increased the envelope in terms of what is covered, they have also reduced the funding.
I do not really want to get into a battle on whether the provinces are right or the federal government is right. I hope sincerely that what the Romanow commission will accomplish for all Canadians is to once and for all depoliticize this entire health care system.
We need a system in which Canadians, regardless of their income, regardless of their age, regardless of their status, whatever it is, have access to basic primary care so that they know, when they take their injured child to any emergency room in any hospital in any community in the entire country, they will receive fair treatment. I do think there will have to be very hard decisions, and not just about funding.
I am sure that everybody's solution to health care is just that the federal government should put more money into the pot, but the reality is that we also have to examine the way we are doing things, the way we deliver community health care. Could care be better given at home in many instances? I think we all know that it is possible and that it should happen more. Could care be given cooperatively, with the Victorian Order of Nurses and others who do wonderful work spending more time going into the home or a seniors' residence and keeping these people out of the hospital infrastructure in the country?
That is not to say that they should be left to suffer in any way. In fact, we want to ensure that their treatment is first class and readily available, available in a way that is not only the most comforting way of delivering health care to them but the most economical way. Because at the end of the day, while we all wrap ourselves in the emotion of the health care system, the taxpayer has to pay for it. I think the taxpayer expects the federal government, every provincial government and every hospital board to be able to deliver services at a fair cost and certainly in an efficient manner.
My second point on the throne speech is one that is very important to me. It deals with the need to help children and families break out of poverty and ensure that all children have a good start in life. As we approach the Thanksgiving weekend, I think we all recognize, particularly in this place but across the country, that we have a lot to be thankful for. At the same time as we celebrate Thanksgiving, we have to realize that there is an anomaly in Canada. We still have too much poverty. We still have families struggling. We still have single moms without housing.
Recently I was astounded to read about a young woman who lived in a YWCA shelter. I also saw an interview with her when I was in Calgary a couple of weeks ago. The reason she was being interviewed is that she had a job. Every day she gets up out of her bed in the shelter, the people at the shelter make her a lunch to take to work and she goes off to work as a receptionist in a dentist's office. I could just see the thrill in her eyes. She was just so delighted to have a job. She does not want to be on welfare.
Let us imagine this. I was astounded to see that someone who is living in a shelter actually has a job. That is not the sort of typical image we think of when we think of people living in shelters, so I did a little more research. I found out that over 50%, an astounding figure, of the people who live in shelters in the city of Calgary go to work every day. Some of them have kids. They send their kids off to school and they go to work.",Liberal,Mississauga West,Steve Mahoney,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=bb250ed1-5b30-460d-9e85-a2006f2dbf47&Language=E&Section=ALL
4226510,ca.proc.d.2002-10-11.1681.3,2002-10-11,,,,intervention,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,What about Toronto?,,,An hon. member,
4226511,ca.proc.d.2002-10-11.1681.4,2002-10-11,bb250ed1-5b30-460d-9e85-a2006f2dbf47,4630,Mr. Steve Mahoney,,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,"Somebody mentioned Toronto. I believe the number in Toronto is about 30%. The number is 60% in the Region of Peel, the community I represent.
The opposition wants to take this as an opportunity to once again bash the government. I would like to point out that there are a number of things the government is doing to attempt to address the issue of homelessness and affordable housing, but we have not done enough. If that satisfies the catcallers and the hecklers, good on them, but in my view the important thing is to recognize it, make the statement in the throne speech and then put in place the programs to try to solve these problems. If anyone here thinks we can do it with the snap of a finger or just simply by pouring money into a problem, that is pretty naive.
The reality is we have an opportunity. We have identified a segment of society living in shelters who go to work at businesses every day. They are proud individuals who do not want to take welfare, who would rather get a paycheque instead of a welfare cheque. They are willing to live in a shelter so they can save for their first and last month's rent. It is a tribute to those people.
Instead of members yelling about it, I would like to see us do something and I am convinced we will do something as a government. As a result of our statements in the throne speech around fighting poverty and investing in affordable housing, we will provide affordable housing on a much broader scale.
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has re-entered that area of social responsibility. We announced agreements on affordable housing with $680 million of federal money matched by the provinces and in some cases the municipalities. Agreements have been signed by 10 provinces and territories, including Ontario where $245 million was signed for in an agreement. By the way, it was the first time in 10 years that we have been able to sign a bilateral agreement with the province of Ontario. We have signed the deal. They have agreed to put in rent supplements in lieu of capital up front which is fine with me as long as it gets the housing, as long as it gets the shovels going into the ground.
People will say it has not happened fast enough and I agree. It is a little frustrating with the bureaucracy at any level, be it the federal level or the provincial level. Frankly, on this deal we have done our job. We have brought the money to the table, put in place the programs, negotiated with the provinces and signed the deals. It is now up to the provinces and the municipalities working in partnership to either match the money or to put in the rent supplements so that these units are affordable and to get the shovels in the ground and get the houses built.
On top of that, there is a further commitment in the throne speech that says we will add to that particular housing agreement, that we will be investing more. It has to go through the budget process now. People will ask how much. The throne speech does not say how much. Canadians understand that a throne speech is not designed to put down the actual dollar amounts; rather it sets out the vision.
The government has committed that there will be additional work done in the area of affordable housing. I have the privilege as the parliamentary secretary responsible for crown corporations to work with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and with Canada Lands Company to develop some new housing initiatives in every part of the country and that work is currently going on.
That is the first step in addressing the issue of poverty. I have heard the opposition say there is no such thing as child poverty; that the children are poor because their families are poor. I tend to agree with that but the reality is the kids are not the ones who can do anything about it. They are captive to the cycle of poverty. Very often a poor child becomes a hungry child and a hungry child is not going to pay attention at school, is not going to learn, is not going to do the homework and is going to act out in some way.
There is certainly a comprehensive need to deal with the poverty of families and children. The end result of that and the reason that vision is so vital in the throne speech is it will help build a stronger Canada with stronger families, people who can get out of the welfare cycle and the poverty cycle and create a great life for themselves.
Let me give an example of the type of thing that people yell about. We will recall in the last throne speech there was an announcement that we would increase the maternity leave from six months to one year. It is not in this throne speech; it was in the previous document. There were howls of indignation from the business community. There were howls of indignation from the benches opposite. I have to say that even I wondered if it was the smart thing to do at the time.
We all develop our ideas by the circumstances in which we live. This summer I was delighted to become the proud grandfather of two new baby boys. My two oldest sons and their wives had kids. Those moms, Karen and Kim, have the opportunity to stay at home to nurture, to breastfeed, to be with those babies in the first year of those babies' lives. Maybe I have a different attitude because my family has finally experienced that.
It was one of the best darned things the government has done since 1993. It is a very simple thing. The business community has not been thrown into chaos. Every time something changes or there is something new, it is Armageddon, “Oh, my goodness, why would you do that? It is going to cost us thousands of dollars. We are going to have to retrain. We are going to have to replace these people. It isn't going to work”. The chambers of commerce, the boards of trade, the official opposition all rant about it.
Then we see mom with the baby and what happens to that baby by having a parent at home with it. It is not necessarily the mom any more; it could be mom or dad. Being with that baby during the first year of life is critically important. I am very proud and pleased the government had the courage to stand up to the hail that ensued after the announcement was made. With kids like my grandkids, it will pay dividends 20 years down the road when they graduate from university because they had a really good solid start. The opportunity was made available to them because the government had the vision in the throne speech to make that change in the way we do business. It was a terrific idea.
It will also be seen in the throne speech that we are moving in the area of affordable housing, in the area of attacking shelters, in working with the minister of homelessness on the SCPI funding, on the renovation funding. The government is in full flight on all those issues and is dealing with them at the community level.
We only have to ask the people at the community level whether or not what I say is true. The municipalities will say they are getting terrific cooperation and they are pleased with the programs being put in place in those areas. They will also say, and I openly admit it, that it is not enough, and it never is. They will also say that it is not fast enough and it never is. But they will say that at least the federal government is recognizing the needs in these areas and they would implore their provincial representatives to do likewise. I am confident that they will across the country, because government bodies are recognizing that once and for all we have to tackle these problems and put in place the solutions to poverty, homelessness and the lack of affordable housing.
The third item regards improving the life chances for aboriginals. The classic example of our doing that was something which again caused demonstrations in the streets and in here. Parliament was held to ransom. It is just an example of how we can work with the aboriginal community. That was the Nisga'a treaty. Now that the treaty is in place, the howls of indignation have calmed down and gone away. People have recognized that it was not Armageddon and the end of the world. In fact, some very good things have happened. I hope sincerely that the vision shown by the Prime Minister in the throne speech will put in place more treaties that will be similar and will accomplish the same thing.
I have spoken before about the environmental aspects of the Kyoto accord. I understand I have only about a minute left so I cannot go into great detail, but I want to say once again, let us just calm down the rhetoric.
We have made changes. We took lead out of gasoline and there were howls. People said, “Oh, my goodness, the sky will fall. We will go broke. We will go out of business”. When we converted to metric, one of the great debates in the nation's history was that it would be the end of the world because the United States was not going metric. Yet today our kids function in the school classrooms. Even if we dinosaurs do not, our children all do.
We need to recognize that the throne speech provides a vision and a direction. It shows not a legacy but in fact what we can do to make this an even greater country for our children and grandchildren and we can leave a place that all Canadians will truly be proud of.",Liberal,Mississauga West,Steve Mahoney,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=bb250ed1-5b30-460d-9e85-a2006f2dbf47&Language=E&Section=ALL

We will indeed have a plan. That plan will be put before Parliament before the vote. That has been made clear. The plan has been a long time in the making. It continues to be a living document. We continue to consult with communities and to talk with industry. That is an ongoing process. That is why it is so disturbing to have people just stand and say, “No, no, no. Do not ratify it.

If there are poor children in Canada, it is because there are poor families. We know that the government slashed the budget for social housing.
There the government had the perfect opportunity to give those $43 billion grabbed from the EI fund back to seasonal workers, to the unemployed in Charlevoix and other ridings in Quebec, and to students.

When people buy insurance they hope they never have to cash in on it. It is like life insurance. The insurance companies are betting people are going to live; people are betting they are going to die, but are hoping the insurance companies are right. It is the same principle.
When we have an employment insurance plan, it must be supported by everyone in the country who is working. Hopefully not everyone will need it and obviously they do not.
Also, I would like to see an accounting over the last 20 or 25 years of how much has gone into employment insurance in terms of direct subsidy from the taxpayer, when the employment insurance program was running a deficit. Nobody talks about that. All members talk and yell about is that it is running a surplus.
We have reduced employment insurance premiums. They are down to about $1.25 from the $2.20 they were when we took office. We have reduced the burden on the business community and the worker.

I would like members to think about all the pussyfooting, and the comments made by our great journalists and editorial writers. They said the throne speech was supposed to be the Prime Minister's legacy after 40 years of political life. They were partly right. The Prime Minister did not deny it. He was proud of his throne speech. It is the legacy he wanted to leave to Canadians and Quebeckers.
Today, I will talk about the legacy the Prime Minister, “the little guy from Shawinigan”, left to Quebec in his 40 years of political life, a legacy that is not mentioned in the throne speech, but should have been. I will talk about Mirabel airport, the biggest mistake ever made by the federal government in Quebec.
During his 40 years in politics, the Prime Minister was a member of the Liberal cabinet for a number of years. Of the 37 years of the Mirabel Airport saga, the Liberals were in power for 26. The present Prime Minister was in one or another portfolio for most of those 26 years. He was one of the cabinet members making decisions and recommendations on Mirabel airport.
This, I should point out, is in my opinion the only true legacy the Prime Minister has left in Quebec. The white elephant of Mirabel is all too typical of him. Discussions on Mirabel began back in 1966 under Lester B. Pearson. It was a major decision. There was Expo 67 and all that. Paris and New York City were building second airports. Montreal was, of course, the air entry point for Canada at that time. It was said that Dorval would no longer be able to accommodate the demand after 1985. The decision was made therefore to build a new airport. This was a political choice made by the Liberal government of the day.
Discussions were held, and a variety of concepts proposed. Would it be built on the north shore or the south? Finally, on March 27, 1969, federal minister Paul Hellyer put an end to the suspense and announced the expropriation of 100,000 acres in the Sainte-Scolastique sector, which has now become the city of Mirabel. At the time, this was bigger than the city of Laval, 10 times larger than other major world airports and 27 times larger than Dorval. More than 3,000 property owners were expropriated or moved. It was often described as the greatest population displacement in the history of Quebec, the greatest population displacement since the deportation of the Acadians.
That same day, on the way to church, Jean Marchand promised that 100,000 jobs would be created in the Mirabel sector. It must be kept in mind, of course, that in 1969 Montreal was still the aviation port of entry into Canada. After much discussion, Mirabel Airport was inaugurated on October 4, 1975. The announcement was made by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Everyone was of course delighted; there were 100,000 acres of land and predictions of major industrial development.
The development plan provided for completion of highways 15 and 50. A rapid train was to reach the airport. Once the work was completed there was going to be--and there still is--a place where trains would arrive. The work was done, in the sense that the airport terminal was built to accommodate trains. Plans were to go ahead and everybody was going to pitch in. The federal government was supposed to invest over $500 million plus another $300 million to complete highways 15 and 50. It was supposed to look after building the necessary infrastructure for the rapid train to arrive directly in the airport terminal.
This is not what happened. Over 25 years later, the reality is quite different. The Liberal government--I will remind members that the Liberals were in power for 26 of the 37 years the Mirabel saga lasted--was being pressured by the establishment, which is mostly controlled by Ontario. Toronto, just like English Canada, has never accepted that Montreal should remain the gateway to Canada for air travel.
What happened between 1975 when the airport was opened and 2002? We have witnessed a shift in air travel, and Toronto is now the gateway to Canada. This is what the Liberal Party establishment of the time wanted, with the support of the Montreal's West Island establishment, which has obviously never accepted that economic development might be exported outside of Montreal's West Island. That is what happened. That is not what history books will say, but it is the political reality. Those decisions were made by the cabinet of the time, of which the current Prime Minister was a member for most of the time the Liberal Party was in power.
Since the airport opened in 1975, there have been various developments, including the creation of ADM in 1996, when one independent airport administration was created to manage both Dorval and Mirabel airports. However, it is important to remember that on December 4, 1986, the federal government decided to keep both airports. Then there was the saga from 1975 to 1986, the period when Canada's gateway shifted from Montreal to Toronto. The Liberal government and representatives at that time, with the complicity of the Conservative government as well, took advantage of the situation, redistributing traffic and redirecting air traffic to Dorval.
So in the end, we have the situation that exists today, where Mirabel is but a shadow of its former self. As far as I am concerned, no matter how you read the Speech from the Throne, in English, in French, backwards or upside down, there is absolutely no mention of the development that could have been achieved with the whole Mirabel airport area.
This is an area that has experienced land grabs over the years. One hundred thousand acres of land were expropriated, and it soon became apparent that the federal Liberal government did not have the will to finish the project according to original plans. Land was returned to those who had been expropriated. In the end, more than 80,000 acres of the 100,000 that had been expropriated were returned.
Today, Mirabel airport covers some 5,000 acres. Another 11,000 acres are rented to the former owners or to new farmers. There is the potential for a further 16,000 acres to be developed, and this could very well have been mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.
While Mirabel has had an increase in job creation lately, it is not solely due to industries in the aviation and aerospace sectors like Bombardier. There is also Technicolor and other businesses that can benefit from moving to industrial parks near airports around the world.
The Government of Quebec decided to create the Mirabel international trade zone, to grant tax credits to attract businesses that would not have settled in Quebec, but that would nonetheless have set up shop near other airports around the world. These tax credits have led to the creation of 2,500 jobs since the international trade zone was created by the Parti Quebecois government.
The Speech from the Throne would have been a good opportunity for the federal government to correct the terrible mistake made with Mirabel, by giving the same tax credits in the international trade zone. The federal government could have done what the Quebec government did, and this would have given us a true duty free zone in Canada, not to compete with businesses in the rest of Canada, but with multinationals that open facilities close to airports all over the world. But we do not have such zones, whether it is in Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal.
There is nothing in the throne speech to help those who were part of the largest displacement of people on Canadian ground since the deportation of the Acadians. Mirabel Airport is the largest tract of federal lands in Quebec. Stop dreaming and thinking that there are some in your region. The largest tract of federal lands is the 100,000 acres the federal government expropriated, and that is located in Quebec. Mirabel Airport was the largest federal property in Quebec.
Now, it has become a white elephant. The Château de l'aéroport, a federally-owned hotel, closed its doors in August 2002. When we travel along highway 50 and drive by Mirabel Airport—we are told that there will still be chartered flights until next spring—we see a hotel, which is closed and whichbelongs to the federal government. ADM, the authority that manages the airport, is not looking for new tenants and is actually suing the previous tenant.
This is a saga. ADM has already been ordered to pay $17 million to the former owner for loss of revenue, because ADM deliberately reduced the number of flights at the airport. Of course, this resulted in a reduction of the number of clients at the hotel. The court sided with the owner. ADM has decided to appeal the ruling.
In the meantime, this federal property, this hotel located alongside the highway, could still attract potential clients, and the owner wanted to discuss a resumption of operations, because there will still be chartered flights and potential clients, at least until spring. But nothing is happening, because ADM is not accountable to the public, and because the federal government, through the Minister of Transport and the Prime Minister, is taking cover behind this independent authority, which is accountable to no one, except itself.
Talk to all the journalists who are trying to reach ADM for whatever reason; it does not even return its calls.
This is a federal asset which is managed by an independent authority, and that suits the present federal government just fine. I would like to quote from a statement by the Prime Minister. I think this is the worst thing that could be disclosed today:

On February 9, 1996, Jean Chrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada, said he will not be sorry when one of these airports closes down, if it seems that one of them is not needed.

He knew very well what was going on. His establishment was protecting Montreal's West Island and Mirabel Airport. So he will not be sorry when Mirabel Airport closes down next spring. He will have contributed to that. During the 40 years he has been a member of Parliament, the “little guy from Shawinigan” has been a minister. During the last 37 years of the Mirabel saga, he was a member of cabinet during most of the 26 years when the Liberal Party was in power. Obviously, he had his say in the decisions made, and he contributed to the fact that the gateway to Canada for air transportation was Montreal in 1966 and has been Toronto since 1985. The Liberal government had a major role to play in the transfer of the gateway from Montreal to Toronto.
It is a real tragedy. More than 500 million dollars was invested in Mirabel Airport and the infrastructure needed for its development has not been built yet. The best way to kill the project was to make an announcement and not follow through by completing highways 15 and 50 and building the infrastructure required for the high speed rail system to get to the terminal that has already been built for it. The train could arrive at the terminal, which exists, but the tracks have not been laid and the investments required to ensure that the train reaches the airport have never been made.
This is what is happening now; this is the dream that has been kept alive among the whole population of Quebec by the Liberal government, by the ministers, by the current Prime Minister among others. It is a dream that will end next spring. As far as I am concerned, Mirabel Airport could have been the legacy of the Prime Minister, “the little guy from Shawinigan”.
I hope that every time he drives by this airport, he will think about it, because he was directly involved, with his cabinet colleagues, including the member for LaSalle—Émard, in the decisions. This member's father was a member of cabinet, and he also had a say in the decisions to close Mirabel Airport and to transfer the Canadian airline gateway from Montreal to Toronto. This is what the Liberal government did.
Ontario is probably grateful for this. Still, there is a harsh reality: we are left with a $500 million plus facility that was left unfinished, and with Dorval Airport, one of the worst airports in the developed world.
My colleagues in the House of Commons should pop in to Dorval to check the condition of that airport. It is the worst in all industrialized countries, and attempts are being made to fix it. Since 1996, over $800 million was poured into Dorval Airport, and another $500 million—for a total in excess of $1 billion—will be required to bring this airport up to modern standards. Why? Because, to do a real good job, the airport should have been shut down for five years, completely torn down and rebuilt from scratch.
Instead, the old building is being renovated, but it dates back to the 1940s. This does nothing for development. The proof is in the figures: a small increase in air traffic; a large one in Toronto, but none in Montreal. All this because the Liberal government put an independent authority, namely ADM, in charge of managing the airports, following in the footsteps of the Conservatives.
Just today, I received a letter the Minister of Transport sent me at the end of September, saying “There is nothing we can do for the Château de l'aéroport, because ADM is in charge and we trust them. They are supposed to manage in the interests of the Government of Canada”. That is not true, ADM is not managing in the interests of the Government of Canada.
At present, ADM is trying as best it can to safe face. The chairman and members of the board are replaced every three years, again, in an attempt to force bad decisions on them. The bad decision was made by the Liberal Party, which was in office during 26 of the 37 years that the Mirabel saga has been going on. For most of this 26-year period, the current Prime Minister was an influential member of cabinet.
I see that there is nothing in the throne speech about de development of the airport at Mirabel. There is every indication that the statement made by the Prime Minister in 1996, when he said that it did not bother him to see an airport close down in Quebec, will translate into reality and actually be his monument, his legacy to the Quebec government: a white elephant, like himself.",Bloc Québécois,Argenteuil--Papineau--Mirabel,Mario Laframboise,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=388af1bd-cbf3-4233-b43d-9ccfe1db0f41&Language=E&Section=ALL

The Chair will be aware that yesterday the Prime Minister made a major policy announcement, perhaps we should call it the Glebe doctrine, at a high school in Ottawa with respect to Canada's position on a possible war with Iraq.
Earlier this week we had a number of occasions to complain that the House of Commons was not being taken seriously and that major policy announcements, for instance the announcement with respect to softwood lumber which was made in British Columbia, were being made outside the House. Yet yesterday the Prime Minister answered a question that many people had been asking of the government for weeks and months, ever since the debate about a possible war in Iraq emerged, and the Prime Minister made this announcement outside the House. He may have had his reasons for doing that.
However, when we come to the House the next day, neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister of Foreign Affairs are here to answer questions with respect to a policy decision that has obviously now been made and announced. When the opposition raised a question with respect to that policy announcement, as I did of the Deputy Prime Minister, did the Deputy Prime Minister answer on behalf of the government? He has the ability to answer on behalf of the government. Did the Minister of National Defence, who was also present, answer? No. Instead, and I think this is a matter of procedure, we received an answer from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
My understanding of the role of parliamentary secretaries is that they answer in the absence of their ministers. I did not ask a question of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I asked a question of the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity, presumably, as one who would be able to defend, explain, reannounce or whatever the policy announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister outside the House of Commons. It is one thing to do it outside the House of Commons. It compounds the error and the lack of respect for the House if, on the next day when questions are asked of the government about that policy announcement that has been made outside of the House the day before, we cannot even get anything higher than a parliamentary secretary, with all due respect to the parliamentary secretary. She did her job just fine.
The fact is we the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defence were here and they declined to answer the question. I think that shows disrespect for the House, and I want to register the way I feel about it.",New Democratic Party,Winnipeg--Transcona,Bill Blaikie,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b42f24b0-65c3-47aa-9997-d0678cacc904&Language=E&Section=ALL

In terms of a question being answered by a parliamentary secretary, the very excellent parliamentary secretary in this case does her job with distinction, Not only that, she has sworn and has a commission the same as others who are charged to answer questions in the House of Commons, as all of us know.
Finally, on the substance of the issue, the Prime Minister did not make an announcement yesterday. The Prime Minister gave a speech to high school students and answered questions from them. Surely no one here would take seriously that elected people in this Parliament can no longer address students in their schools.

I will leave the question period part alone. However, with regard to the Prime Minister's statement, I feel it was a major statement that had not been made inside the House before. I agree with my colleague from the NDP.
I can only suggest to the government House leader that this is happening more and more. Since the Prime Minister has announced that he is leaving, major announcements are made outside the House.

Question period, as the Speaker would know, is but 45 minutes a day in which members of the opposition are afforded the opportunity to ask direct questions of ministers of the Crown. We have seen numerous instances in the past two weeks, since Parliament resumed, where ministers have been present and sat stoney faced on the front bench while parliamentary secretaries leapt to their feet in their defence. This very much undermines the purpose of accountability, the purpose of direct responsibility to the people of Canada through members of the opposition who have every right to raise questions of those ministers when they are present. The government seems very content, although it states otherwise, to undermine the concept of accountability.
The Chair will know, as an active participant and co-author of the modernization report, that every effort was to be made and pledges were given that a greater emphasis would be put on making announcements in the House of Commons and being directly accountable to the House and therefore to the people of Canada.

The situation in Mirabel is a total fiasco and the federal government is entirely responsible for it, because it did not live up to its responsibilities.
Having said this, I would like to have the hon. member's opinion on another problem that is of great concern in Quebec. I am referring to the whole issue of workers, because there is absolutely nothing for them in the throne speech. There is nothing on orphan clauses and on young people who get their first job and whose working conditions are not the same as those of olders workers. There is also the issue of pregnant and nursing women.
There is so little in the throne speech that the same program was announced three times. A pilot program was announced three times in two weeks in the House. Let us be clear. A pilot program is not a permanent program; it is spread over a three year period. The government had to make this announcement three times, because it has nothing else to announce to pregnant women who, under federal jurisdiction, have absolutely no protection. It simply does not exist at the federal level.
There is also the antiscab legislation. What do we do with people who currently have no bargaining power? The throne speech is also silent on this. Workers who pay taxes are always the ones forgotten by the Prime Minister and his government. These people are often the ones who pay the most taxes; they also pay the employment insurance premiums, but they cannot even get benefits.
I wonder if the hon. member could elaborate on this and give us his views.",Bloc Québécois,Laurentides,Monique Guay,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d7ee00c8-04df-4418-965b-962c7d488878&Language=E&Section=ALL

These workers were laid off and they must live with the existing employment insurance legislation. A two-week penalty applies to all of them. I want to make a brief summary of the situation at Mirabel's Château de l'Aéroport.
Let us not forget that the Château de l'Aéroport, that is, the building itself, is owned by the federal government and is located on Tansport Canada land, which means it is federally owned.
This hotel belongs to the federal government, which sublet it to ADM. This means that ADM manages all federal equipment and goods at Mirabel and Dorval airports.
So, ADM manages the hotel according to the conditions of the lease. There is a lease and ADM had a sub-tenant, Mr. Corbeil. Mr. Corbeil took legal action against ADM because the decision to transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval has meant a loss of traffic and a loss of clientele, which violates the lease that was negotiated with ADM. In the spring of 2002, the court ruled in favour of Mr. Corbeil.
ADM appealed the ruling, but Mr. Corbeil was awarded $17 million. The court ordered ADM to pay Mr. Corbeil. Obviously, the employees figured “As long as the case is under appeal, we are guaranteed a job until it is settled”, particularly since there were still flights in and out of the airport. The transfer still has not finished. It will be completed next year. There are still potential clients. The day the hotel closed, it had 150 guests. That is the harsh reality for the workers.
On June 26 ADM's appeal was heard. Or rather, ADM won the right to appeal. Obviously, the sub-tenant, Mr. Corbeil, asked to close the hotel for the duration of the appeal, because he was losing too much money. The court found in his favour on July 27. The court allowed him to cease operations. He announced to his employees that they would be laid off in one month's time.
These are people who, because of the delay for the appeal hearing and because of the fact that the sub-tenant had been awarded $17 million, figured it would probably take between one and two years, that there would be time to find another sub-tenant, another manager for the business. No one ever thought that ADM, the federal government's tenant, and the owner, the federal government, would allow the establishment to sit empty. That is the current Liberal government.
It does not give two hoots about employees, the men and women who work there. Less than one month later, the workers at the Château de l'Aéroport, some 160 men and women, received their pink slips and had to contend with the current employment insurance rules: the infamous two week waiting period, which is a penalty the Bloc Quebecois has been denouncing for years, since this is a program that belongs to workers.
It has been some years since the federal government stopped contributing to this fund. Only the workers and the employers pay into it and they might be prepared to make changes. Their reaction would be “If we had our own insurance, truly worker-administrated, then for sure we would not have a two week penalty period”. But no, the administrator of the fund is the federal government, which helps itself to the surplus to pay down its debt. That is what it does. That is the harsh reality our workers have to deal with.
The workers at the Château de l'Aéroport, the people of the ridings of Laurentides and of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel and of the neighbouring ridings, all have to cope with these laws. There certainly are women on maternity leave who are having to cope with them, and are not covered by the pilot project the minister has just announced, and has been announcing on and off since the start of this session. The same pilot project has been announced three times. Three different members have asked questions, members with problems in their ridings. They always ask the same minister the same question, and she always gives the same answer, “There is a pilot project in Quebec, and some day it will get to you”. That is the harsh reality.
That is the reaction, as they try to sell the public the message, “See, we are looking after it”, but they are not looking after it. An experiment is under way that will have no results for the people who need help. There will certainly be no results felt by the 160 employees of the Château de l'Aéroport de Mirabel, who were working in a federally owned building.
The federal government has put an independent authority called ADM, which is not accountable to the public, in charge of managing it. These people are not elected. They are not even taking journalists' questions, let alone those from unions or MPs. Basically, they are not answering questions from anyone.
The government is hiding. After receiving the minister's letter, I asked that a mediator be appointed. After one meeting, the workers received their pink slips and, on August 15, immediately after the decision was made, I filed a request with the Minister of Transport, saying “Call in a mediator. This is insane”.
What is even more insane is that, while there are people interested in subletting the hotel, ADM could not care less. They are in court, before the courts, appealing the trial decision. What matters to them is to challenge the $17 million they were ordered to pay by the trial court.
Meanwhile, they could not care less about what happens to the workers. They are not making any public statements or answering any questions from journalists or MPs. That is the reality. That is how this Liberal federal government is managing the facilities that it owns.
I repeat that the Château de l'aéroport, the Mirabel airport hotel off highway 50, belongs to the federal government. It is its building, its hotel complex, which it rented out to ADM, which in turn sublet it to someone by the name of Corbeil. Today, it is vacant, because of a court battle.
What is worse is that 160 men and women have lost their jobs and are subject to the current Employment Insurance Act, to which we are asking amendments be made. The federal government is handing out scraps, like the $1.3 million aid package for the workers. Once again, this is being criticized. Not that my hon. colleague from Laurentides, who is an expert in labour relations, has not been calling for it, but the pilot program that was just announced should be made permanent for all pregnant women across Canada and Quebec. That is what we are asking for.
Why implement a pilot program? To buy a bit more time in order to save a little more money perhaps, so that they can hand out more goodies to their friends. This is the harsh reality with this Liberal government: handouts to friends.",Bloc Québécois,Argenteuil--Papineau--Mirabel,Mario Laframboise,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=388af1bd-cbf3-4233-b43d-9ccfe1db0f41&Language=E&Section=ALL

My colleague from Selkirk—Interlake, who is the agriculture critic, wanted me to make sure that the desires of the farmers of Canada were made known to Parliament. As such, he asked me to read into the record a letter that came from the Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association. This letter was addressed to the Prime Minister of Canada. I will read what the letter highlights. It states:

Saskatchewan agricultural producers will remember the Throne Speech that opened up the 37th Parliament of Canada not for what it contained, but for what it lacked. It was called “The Canada we want”, but is it really? In a year of serious drought devastation, agriculture was mentioned in three short lines with no short-term or long-term answers to the desperate situation of many farm businesses.
The Throne Speech stated that the government would implement the Agriculture Policy Framework (APF). However, the agriculture industry needs rejuvenation not more regulation, which the APF will impose.
The government has also committed to solve trade disputes in agriculture. Although important, grain and oilseed farmers' returns are dedicated by foreign policy. The federal and provincial governments must continue to pursue the level playing field between subsidized countries and our own. It was this commitment that was missing from the Throne Speech.
The Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association firmly believes that the federal government, under your direction, must engage in strategies and policies that will reduce costs to producers, increase the efficiencies of our cumbersome transportation system, solve labour disputes that are disrupting grain exports at the Vancouver Port as we speak and enhance the profitability of our sector. These are the key points that were sadly missed in the Throne Speech.
What is the federal government, under your direction, doing to solve the Vancouver Port lockout situation, solve grain transportation inefficiencies and level the playing field with competitive countries such as the United States and Europe?

The association is looking forward to the response from the Prime Minister.
Having said that, I would now like to turn to the part of the throne speech that deals with my portfolio, which is international cooperation and foreign aid.
Before I begin I would like to advise that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Vancouver Island North.
Following the G-8 summit, which was touted as a development summit and at which the issue of foreign aid became the focus point of the Prime Minister, as many would like to say, for him to leave his legacy behind, in the throne speech he mentioned in passing his commitment to foreign aid. What he said was that the foreign aid budget would be double the amount by the year 2010.
It is fine for the Prime Minister to say in the throne speech that for the next 10 years the government will double the foreign aid commitment. The only problem is that he will not be in office. He will be leaving in the year 2004, as he has stated. Why the commitment to foreign aid for the next 10 years when another government may or may not keep it? One has to wonder whether this is a genuine commitment, and it is probably not.
Let me talk for a minute about the previous record the government had before it went to the G-8 and started talking about leaving a legacy for third world countries or for giving foreign aid.
Under the government, in 1999 dollars, Canada dropped its total amount of aid by 25% in the 1990s. The government has been doing a very good job of manipulating, through its spin doctors, and leaving the impression among Canadians that foreign aid has increased and that we are doing well with foreign aid. However, the reality is totally different.
From 1989 to day, Canada, on an average of OECD donor countries, and it is the rich countries of the world that form OECD and give out dollars, gives a full third lower aid than the OECD average of .39% of GDP.
The action in the past has not matched and will not match the future, or the rhetoric that the government is talking about in foreign aid, which is its commitment over the next 10 years to double the amount when the principal architect of the Africa plan, the Prime Minister, will not be in office.
In 1998, most disturbingly, the government reduced the percentage of total official aid going to sub-Saharan Africa from 45.3%, in the 1990s to 35.5%.
Let me repeat that because this $500 million that was given for the Africa fund, that is touted about giving aid to sub-Sahara, Africa, is now on the agenda. There is also the NEPAD issue, which the government likes to tout, but its record in the past has been that it has reduced aid from 45.3% to 35.5%.
The government has a terrible record of giving aid. It ties its aid so that its friends and companies owned by its friends benefit from this foreign aid while it goes around the world touting that it is giving aid.
My friend on the other side should listen to the statistics. The statistics do not lie. Canada has the second worst record of tying official aid, second only after Greece. Canada has tied 75% of its aid to purchasing Canadian goods and services. The World Bank has stated that tied aid is 25% more inefficient. That is the record of the government.
In the throne speech, the government stated that the plan is to increase foreign aid by double the amount and honour the commitment it made in Monterrey of an 8% annual increase. So here it is, talking something, as usual, and doing something else. That is what is in the throne speech.
What I would like to point out is that we in the official opposition want to ensure that the foreign aid dollars that are currently earmarked are properly used for the advantage of the people, not used as this tied aid is indicating, for its friends, and trying to pretend that we are doing goods things. Let us do it. Let us stop the rhetoric.",Canadian Alliance,Calgary East,Deepak Obhrai,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=9f0040ba-a9d7-4aa4-b2e4-f3213a4e024f&Language=E&Section=ALL

I will start by saying that the government just does not get it.
In terms of our international trade relationships under the government, our relations with our major trading partner, the partner for 85% of our trade, and that is our trade with the U.S., has gone backwards.
When we are trading with the United States I think we have to recognize that it is the most self-sufficient and developed nation in the world. It can and does focus very much on what kind of imports it is importing because it can afford to do that. It also has the strongest domestic trade legislation in the developed world.
It is also true that the World Trade Organization and NAFTA rules are strengthening and that has become a more effective way for a nation such as Canada to offset the strong domestic trade legislation of our trading partners. This is largely a consequence of the fact that the U.S. itself has found WTO and NAFTA legal routes a very effective way to go as well.
Canada must remain a reliable partner that pulls above our weight in terms of the international community. Under the present government, we have seen nine years of neglect. Canada pulls below its weight when it comes to our armed forces and that affects our diplomacy, our trade relationships and many other things in a negative way.
I would like to spend some time talking about the softwood lumber dispute which is the major trade dispute between Canada and the U.S. I also want to make reference to the steel dispute. This is an area where the U.S. has made a very good decision in exempting Canada from tariffs on steel. Here we have our very own international trade panel recommending that Canada put tariffs on U.S. steel entering Canada. Our cabinet has to make a decision. I do not understand why this has been so drawn out when it makes so much sense to just reverse that decision.
When we heard the throne speech, the major and most significant trade dispute in Canadian jurisdiction, remembering that Canada is the most dependent on trade of any developed nation, was not given a mention beyond the fact that the government would continue to behave as it has been behaving in terms of the softwood dispute. There was no mention of a financial assistance package in the throne speech in order to maintain Canadian resolve for our workforce in the forest industry, Canadian resolve for the companies and resolve within the broaden communities involved so heavily, the 200 and some forest dependent communities throughout Canada.
Finally, last Tuesday I was able to extract a promise from the trade minister that there would be a financial assistance package forthcoming. That financial assistance package was announced and it fails on all fronts to address the mission statement, which is to ensure Canadian resolve and morale is bolstered and supported so we can maintain a unified position until we resolve the softwood dispute with the U.S., which we will surely win with all our legal challenges because we are on the right side and all legal advice says so.
The current federal government inaction in our softwood lumber dispute with the U.S. is making Canada vulnerable to U.S. divide and conquer tactics. The minister's failure to provide leadership at the national level has led to the situation where we now have B.C., Quebec and other provinces holding direct discussions with the U.S. commerce department. Canada is in jeopardy of losing in two ways. We could lose the legal underpinning of our federally organized WTO and NAFTA challenges if one province makes a deal and we could lose like we did back in 1996 when we agreed to a deal that would turn out to be continually subverted by U.S. lumber coalition special interests and by the U.S. Congress.
All of this might make some sense if Canada were losing on the legal front or if Canada's forest policies and practices were unfair, but of course we are winning at the WTO and we will win at NAFTA. That is exactly why U.S. Department of Commerce Undersecretary Aldonas is currently attempting to lead softwood discussions in a different direction.
For 20 years Canada and the U.S. have fought over softwood. Some U.S. producers have lobbied the U.S. government for trade actions against Canadian producers, alleging that the Canadian product either harms their industry or is heavily subsidized through artificially low stumpage rates on publicly held forest lands.
As a result of all of this, the most recent trade actions by the U.S. lumber coalition have now provided a textbook example of the law of unintended consequences. Though the Canadian lumber industry has suffered greatly since the imposition of countervail and anti-dumping tariffs just this past May, the U.S. industry has not benefited. The price of lumber has actually gone down in the U.S. because of two factors. Some companies have increased production in order to reduce their unit costs to ensure that they beat the anti-dumping tariff formula. In addition, exports to the U.S. from Scandinavian and other sources have increased sharply.
Consequent to these trade actions, Canada launched multiple appeals at WTO and NAFTA . In July the WTO preliminary finding was that the U.S. had misrepresented and miscalculated its finding of Canadian subsidies. This was no surprise to us. I conclude that the U.S. Department of Commerce has concluded that Canada is likely to win subsequent decisions and consequently is trying to undermine these downstream decisions by co-opting the provinces into endorsing another path.
The U.S. commerce department will prepare forest stumpage policy bulletins for the provinces this November, with the understanding that the provinces will be able to somehow show compliance and have their tariff rates reduced. What a recipe for disaster it would be to have a Canadian consensus broken in that way. The U.S. commerce department would then be able to tell NAFTA and WTO panels next spring that there is no need for the U.S. to comply with legal rulings because they have a separate arrangement endorsed by the provinces.
While this U.S. strategy is playing out, guess what, the Canadian trade minister with responsibility for trade issues is missing in inaction and his department is sending only observers to the U.S. commerce department meetings with the provinces. What is the time line for all of this? Most optimistically, the commerce undersecretary's proposals are for a year and a half. This is not significantly different from what it would take us to pursue our legal options or challenges.
To conclude, the federal government should lead all softwood discussions and negotiations. It needs to immediately implement not what was announced this week but an effective forestry assistance program and it needs to relentlessly pursue our legal options to their ultimate conclusion. Canada requires free trade in order to secure the future for our softwood lumber and value added industries, for our workers, for our communities and for our companies.",Canadian Alliance,Vancouver Island North,John Duncan,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cb60b9db-e3bd-48d9-af20-0b0702a06589&Language=E&Section=ALL

The first deals with the softwood lumber issue. I would like him to describe roughly the actual numbers of individuals who have been affected by this, who have lost their jobs, in contrast to the government's position and claim that very few people, if any, have lost their jobs over this. Second, on the same area in relation to softwood lumber, because of government inaction the damage has already been done to our softwood lumber industry. I would like him to tell us what we can do, what the government should have done, and more important, what we need to do now to give our softwood lumber industry the chance to save peoples' jobs and to get back on its feet and be competitive.
The second question deals with the transport issue and the airport tax. The government has levied a $24 airport tax that is destroying smaller communities across the country. It is impeding economics because people are not flying. They cannot afford it. The money has gone into general revenues, not into security. I ask the hon. member whether he would agree with the notion that the airport tax should be cut down to a more reasonable $8 to $9, which is in keeping with what there is in the U.S. That tax is directed right toward security, including for security personnel on the front lines, for equipment, for training and for wages. Lastly, I wonder whether the member is going to make an initiative with other political parties to get that airport tax down to $10 so we can save the economies of small rural communities, not only in B.C. but across this country, and of the airlines, which are having a very difficult time enduring this airport tax.",Canadian Alliance,Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca,Keith Martin,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c&Language=E&Section=ALL

The actual number of people unemployed is a somewhat difficult number to calculate. The IWA, the Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers union, as of this week estimates that there are 6,033 people unemployed as a consequence of the dispute, 8 sawmills closed and 20 on reduced operations. That is in British Columbia, northern Ontario and part of Quebec where they have certification and jurisdiction. Certainly that number on a national basis, expanded by people from other certifications or by people who are not certified union workers, would mean that we have a very large number of people out of work because of this softwood dispute.
The main difficulty I have with the government announcement on financial assistance is that it deals with none of the nuts and bolts of what was being asked for in common sense support in order to retain people in the industry and keep companies in the game in terms of being able to export. There are two things. One is an expansion of employment insurance. Already there are people whose employment insurance benefits have expired. They have been told that their only option is welfare and social assistance. This government program did not deal with that issue whatsoever. It needs to deal with that.
On the other issue, the main thing that could be done, particularly for small and medium sized companies, is a loan guarantee program so that the tariff liability until such time as it will be reimbursed can be covered with government guarantees. That is something we have been putting out there in conjunction with industry since last spring. That is what has been promised by the Minister of Natural Resources since June. The government still has not delivered on that very specific proposal.

I want to talk to the House and those people listening out there today about capital markets. Some people will ask what that has to do with the Speech from the Throne. This is an area of the Speech from the Throne that possibly has not been talked about a lot in the House, although we have had a few questions from the Bloc on this issue.
A very interesting aspect of the Speech from the Throne talked about Canada's fragmented securities regulatory structure being “inadequate and an obstacle to growth”. I think that is a very bold statement, because I can well remember when I first came to this place back in 1993 that I was very concerned about having a very fragmented registration system for securities across this country. I thought it was very much an impediment to our growth as a nation. I did some initial research and discovered a humongous roadblock called federal-provincial relations.
As most of us know, our country was founded in Confederation by the British North America Act back in 1867, which was a very long time ago. Some of the innovation occurring in our marketplaces today moves at the speed of light. In this city, as a matter of fact, we have a huge high tech industry that is doing some tremendously interesting and innovative things. Most of us are aware of Canada's investment in the space program. In fact my own son is involved in some of these things, so I am particularly interested in what Canadians can do and in the opportunities that are available to them.
When I look at this whole issue of capital markets in Canada, to me it is a statement about our inability as a country to work together for the best interests of all the people of Canada. When we talk about capital markets, the stock exchanges and so forth, some people have an aversion to it and think we are just making some kind of intellectual or economic comment, but in reality the movement of capital and the concept of innovation are very much part and parcel of the same thing. If we have capital and innovation, we can create great things in this country. We have done that in the past.
Up to the 1970s, Canadians were great savers. That was historically what Canadians did. We had a conservative approach to things. We put things in banks and for that reason our banks and our banking structure were very important to us. We spent a lot of time in this place and in others ensuring that our banks were solid, had a good regulatory framework and were national in scope, that they had the ability to protect people's savings. People had some confidence in putting capital into those banks. Of course banks then were able to do things like loaning mortgages and so forth, basically creating an alchemy of innovation and capital for the benefit of all the people of Canada.
Since 1970 Canadians have gradually moved from being savers to being investors. Indeed, one out of two people in Canada today has some form of investment, whether it is in pension systems or in direct investments in the stock markets, teachers' pensions, et cetera. Indeed, I am a member of the baby boom generation. I am very much at the forefront of that. I was born in 1946. The baby boomers are now talking about retiring. Retirement plans are very much related to their ability to invest so that those investments will return cash flow in their retirement. Canadians are now investors, but the reality is that in Canada we have a tremendously fractured capital market. What I mean by this is that because it is a provincial domain each province and territory has its own regulatory framework for controlling investments for stock markets.
The result is a tremendous amount of overlap and duplication. Canada is a very small country when it comes to the whole aspect of a capital market. We only represent something like 2.07% of the world's capital market. Therefore, in some ways we are a small player but having said that, the Toronto Stock Exchange is the third largest stock exchange in North America.
On a comparative basis, we can look at what other countries have done. Canada is one of the very few countries in the world that does not have a national securities administration. When I say that, I think of countries like Australia. It has recently realized that with only about 1% of the world's capital market, it was unable to have a fractionalized capital system and still provide the opportunities for investment, to attract investment capital and to create jobs in that country with a fractionalized system. Australia had the wherewithal to think ahead and create a national securities commission.
We all know that the United States has a national securities administration. The European Union is going through a consolidation in many of its industrial areas, not the least of which is the fact that it has come to the recognition that it must have a national securities administration. In Europe there is a two tier system; one is a national security administrator, but it allows the individual states to still do the enforcement and so forth.
I would suggest that is not a bad framework for Canada. Imagine at the same time that Canada is dragging up the rear with 13 different regulatory environments and with politicians getting involved in the process. We do not want the big, bad federal government getting involved in the regulatory framework and so forth. That may not be the model we are looking at, but it is clear we need to move forward on this file.
People talk about the regulatory framework in Canada. For instance, I believe a member of the Alberta Stock Exchange said it takes 17 months to change one regulation. That is the average in the province of Alberta and it is probably the same in every other province. The Toronto Stock Exchange just went through a changeover to a different trading system. It took four years to implement that.
Different provinces are all going off on different tangents on this. Of course, the province of Quebec does not want to be part of anything that looks national in scope. It wants to have a regulatory regime that includes all financial sectors under one umbrella. The capital markets of Canada are simply too small to fractionalize. The countries that do fractionalize, in the final analysis, are not thinking of the best interests of their own people. They are not thinking of the ability to innovate and create opportunities for their own people. They are putting their politics in front of the best interests of their people.
National governments do national things. In all the time we have spent debating in this country there has been a great theory of devolution of power from the federal government to the provinces. The fact of the matter is this is one particular file where it is time that everyone in the country came to the recognition that there is a purpose for a national regulatory system.
I am going to digress for a moment to talk about some of the things that have really had a tremendous negative impact on investor confidence. I was visited recently by people in my own profession, chartered accountants. They were telling me they have to react to some of the very negative things that have happened in the United States and other capital markets, the Enrons, the WorldComs and so forth.
As we look at the stock markets today, people are fleeing from them. They do not trust the institutions that exist there today. This is going to have a negative impact eventually because small entrepreneurial companies are starting up in a very difficult time to raise capital.
Once again I think of the infrastructure that exists in this city and in Quebec, Vancouver, Calgary and other parts. I think Saskatoon has a tremendous emerging high tech sector. The government is going to make it more and more difficult for people to get access to capital, to turn those good ideas into commercial products, to turn those good ideas into something that not only the local people but all the people in the country can take advantage of. We can export that kind of technology.
To diverge a bit once more, we have been talking about the importance of Kyoto. One of the important aspects of Kyoto is that Canada be a leader, that we take advantage of some of the technology that we can evolve if we are there first. If industry is going to be there last, the person who is into this game last will pay the highest price and will be the least competitive. Many of our corporations realize that.
Suncor and others in Alberta and other parts of Canada realize the importance of being there first. I heard DuPont Chemicals say the other day, “We subscribe to Kyoto. We are going to be there first because our production costs will be lower than anybody else's dragging up the rear taking their time to get there”.
Any benefits that we could get from the technology sector in Kyoto will be mitigated if we do not find a better way to raise capital and if we do not find a better way to harmonize and modernize our capital system.
I said it was costly. There is an example of a company that wanted to raise $600,000 for a mining operation in Alberta. The cost to that company to raise $600,000 by going through the capital markets was $300,000. That was partly for registration and so forth in the various security exchanges, but it was also for all the legal work, the lawyers and accountants and so forth. In other words, the bottom line is it is prohibitive. Nobody is going to do it for small amounts of money. Even for larger amounts of money it is questionable whether a person would go to the Canadian capital markets today.
I have heard many people in the corporate sector say that if they are serious about raising money, they go to the United States. The U.S. has a robust system. It is possible to get things registered there. It is quicker to get on the securities market and it is possible to raise more money and do it faster.
There is a problem with that philosophy and it is possible to study the history of this file. If the company's stock is being issued on the U.S. stock exchange, inevitably the company will become an American company. The control of the company will be in the United States. The people making the decisions will be in the United States and Canadians will simply be working for those other people who are calling the shots. That has been somewhat the history of our country; we have let other people call the shots because we did not have the capital to do it.
But Canadians do have the capital. We have to unlock that key to our capital markets by creating a robust system. That is why I was very happy to see in the Speech from the Throne that the government was very interested in finding a way of doing this. Discussions have gone on with some of the provincial governments on this. I say discussions because since 1993 I have been interested in this file and those discussions have been going on all that time.
It is time to act. It is time to put some meat on the bone. The people in the provincial capitals should park their baggage for a bit. They should stop worrying about how to devolve power from the federal government and start saying “This is an issue that requires a national regulatory regime and we are prepared to stand up to the plate and do that and work with the government”.
It does not mean we would have some huge regulatory regime or governmental regime here in Ottawa or Toronto. Different models could be used where this two tier system of regulatory framework could be achieved and which everyone could agree on. The enforcement could be taken on by the provincial administration. The object of the exercise is to reduce costs to make this an efficient, vibrant, securities administration.
Earlier I used the example of Australia, but imagine that the Nordic states, all of Scandinavia, have come together to create one stock exchange. I am talking about Norway, Sweden and Denmark. These are independent countries that have come together to make an arrangement. They realize that without that ability, without the opportunity of scale that they will not be able to attract capital and they will not have the opportunities that other capital markets will have.
Those countries have realized that, yet here in Canada we continue to lag behind them. We continue to not be a part of the solution, but part of the problem. We continue to argue back and forth between provincial capitals about who should be on side and who should not.
As a matter of fact, we have had supporters go in and out on this file. The CEO of the Toronto Stock Exchange, Mrs. Stymiest, has been a great advocate. I have been a follower of her career to some extent. She has been a great promoter because she realizes this is something that is mitigating Canadians from realizing their potential.
Without this we are going to continue to subjugate Canada as a junior market and a junior business environment. We are going to ensure that Canada's productivity will decline. We have to catch up. People talk about our productivity deficit. We have to catch up to the United States.
The mathematics is we have to be 1.6% more productive than the United States every year to catch up and to make ourselves competitive. The only way we are going to do that is by squeezing that last ounce of efficiency out of our business system. The only way we are going to do that in this area is to stop the duplication, create greater harmonization and have a single focus as we go out to parade a national securities administration.
I have talked at long length on this issue, but if we were sitting at home today looking at the stock market pages, we would see that the stock markets continue to ratchet downward. Some say a lot of people are not affected by that and too bad for those who are, but the reality is we have a significant lack of confidence in our capital system in North America today.
This is not about the rich and the famous. It is about the workers of the country who have their money invested in their own companies. The workers have their money invested in pension funds. It is somewhat of a disconnect and a lot of people cannot relate the connection between those capital markets and the best interests of their families, but the reality is that we are all impacted by this. Without the opportunity for capital formation effectively, without the ability to instil that capital in new burgeoning innovative technologies, Canada and those families are being put at risk.
We have to work together as a federal government with our counterparts in the provinces to park the baggage of where we are going on this issue. We have to do away with the rhetoric that has occurred in the past.
The people who run the Vancouver Stock Exchange see it as quite a different stock exchange from some of the others in the country, but some people will have to park their baggage. We have to have a regulatory framework.
The accounting bodies are trying to get voluntary compliance to ensure there are ethical standards. We are big on ethical standards around here, but the problem is the business sector has a huge ethical problem itself right now. We need to find a way to do that. I do not think voluntary compliance is going to work. We need a regulatory environment that works. Canada has a great opportunity to do that. I am very much in favour of the throne speech which talks about moving in this general direction. I hope all of us will support that when whatever legislative framework comes up in the future.",Liberal,Durham,Alex Shepherd,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c3382513-ff2b-4b99-9224-0691117fe67b&Language=E&Section=ALL

I have often thought that the federal government is preoccupied with trying to find ways to invade provincial jurisdiction, things like health, education and social services and abandons other areas that it has clear constitutional power to deal with. Section 91 gives the federal government the power to deal with trade in commerce and any conflict in constitutional law between that and provincial property and civil rights is usually won out by the federal government.

The reality is that commercial law is a provincial jurisdiction. That has been set out I think from 1967 onward and is where the evolution of these exchanges has occurred.
The irony of course is that while they are a provincial jurisdiction, it is not uncommon that a corporation that has all its business in the province of British Columbia will list on the Toronto Stock Exchange solely and therefore be governed entirely by the Ontario securities administration. There is a lot of irony that exist.
It is clear that the provinces still covet their position in the area of commercial law to the point that they feel it is their jurisdiction to regulate securities within their borders. That in fact is the big constitutional issue.
I do not believe that the federal government has the jurisdictional authority to simply create a national securities administration.

I want to begin by saying that I am sharing my time with my colleague, the member for Dartmouth.
In the current throne speech, it says that:

Canadians want their government to be open, accountable and responsive to their diverse and changing needs...the government will provide clear guidelines and better enforcement of the ethical standards expected of elected officials and senior public servants.

These are words, obviously, and not deeds. On Wednesday, in this House, I asked about political interference by some ministers of the Crown on the matter of riding boundaries and I want to elaborate on that before this packed chamber this afternoon.
The Prime Minister was one of the few current MPs who was actually here in 1964, when key progressive changes were made by the 26th Parliament regarding the distribution of federal ridings and new boundaries.
In the current review of boundaries, we are now aware that at least three political ministers managed to get their grubby, little fingers into the process and compromised the independence and impartiality of those commissions.
In his response on Wednesday, the Prime Minister chose to say that I was attacking the position of the Speaker. I want to say most emphatically I was not. I happen to have a very high regard for the position of Speaker and even higher regard for the present incumbent who we elected following the 2000 election. However the Prime Minister was half right. It was an attack on a government that has grown too comfortable in office and grasps at every bit of additional power, leverage and influence that it can. That is what I was attacking and it needs to be done, because the changes in the way that we proceed with boundaries was fundamentally reformed in 1964, after 90 years of blatant gerrymandering.
I spent an invigorating evening reading the debates that went on in 1964 involving such parliamentary luminaries as John Diefenbaker, Tommy Douglas, Jack Pickersgill, Allan McEachern, Gordon Churchill, Stanley Knowles and Gilles Grégoire. It is crystal clear that these members of Parliament in that minority government were working hard, labouring to reach an accommodation and an understanding that would end these decades of partisan gerrymandering and make the process fair for all political parties and, equally important, for all Canadians.
They were trying, in other words, to put into practice what Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent had said in 1952 on the topic of redistribution. He said that it was not a matter of executive policy, that is the treasury benches, but it was a matter and responsibility for the House as a whole.
Then there was the intervention of Dr. Norman Ward, a well known political scientist, who said that the government pays lip service to this idea of fair redistribution. Then he went on to say that:

This doctrine, resting as it does on the premise that ministers can forget they are ministers whenever redistribution comes up, and that their supporters can forget it too, put an increasing strain on the credulity of opposition members as the debates wore on.

Is that not exactly the position that the public works minister finds himself in now, where his office conceded that the two people appointed in Saskatchewan were indeed recommendations of that individual?
Jack Pickersgill, who was the transport minister in 1964 and who led this debate in the House, had some excellent opinions on this matter of fair redistribution. He said:

The first and by far the most important of these was that we should not follow the pattern that had been followed in the first 90 years since confederation, of having the readjustment of representation in this place done in this place by its members directly, but that it should be done by somebody which would be as impartial as we in our collective ingenuity could provide and who would be as competent as we could find means to provide through legislation and subsequent appointment.It was also agreed that in the process the government should have no more voice than any other part of the house, because this was a business that was peculiarly the business of parliament, of all of parliament, where we all have an equal obligation and, I hope and think, an equal desire to see that the people are fairly represented.

Mr. Pickersgill went on to say:

--I should like to say parenthetically that there is a real problem in getting people who will not only be fair but who will appear to everyone to be fair.

For the record that I have nothing personally against the two individuals who were appointed to do the boundary redistribution in Saskatchewan. I do not know them. They are probably terrific at their day job. They may even write a brilliant report. However that is not the point. The point is one cannot have a partisan way of selecting two of three commissioners and then try to convince the residents of Saskatchewan that, even though they were appointed by a political minister, they have suddenly become impartial and non-partisan from here on in.
The Pearson government in 1964 understood that and understood it well. This bunch over here today, 38 years later, has totally forgotten it.
Again, Mr. Pickersgill said:

--in order to insure what after all is the most priceless of all our constitutional rights in this country, the right of all our citizens to have as nearly as possible an equal voice in the government of this country.

He went on to say that none of these appointments would be made by the government. He was in debate with someone at this point when he said:

--that is the point the hon. gentleman does not seem to grasp. Under this bill, no appointments would be made by the government at all...

That was precisely the thing to which Mr. Pickersgill objected during the debate two or three years before. He said that they were not going to transfer redistribution from Parliament to the government. He said:

I have never varied from that view, and it is for this reason that in this bill we have been very careful to have no appointments made by the government but to have appointments made by parliament or officers of parliament.

The debate began with the assumption that the chief justice would appoint the chair of each boundary commission with the prime minister and leader of the opposition appointing the other two. However Stanley Knowles and others pointed out that would not be fair necessarily to other Canadians who never voted for either of the old-line parties.
They proposed a Manitoba model that had a university professor, the chief electoral officer and the chief justice of the province. There were some problems with doing it that way in the parties because some provinces had more than one university and there were discussions about presidents and which one would be chosen.
To make a long story longer, on November 10, 1964, there was a compromise. Again it was Mr. Pickersgill, the transport minister, who recommended that the other two people, other than the appointee of the chief justice, would be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Commons. He said at that time who better to trust than his hon. the Speaker to do the sensible thing and not to put any strings upon him except the obvious string that these appointments must be made from persons resident in the province. That was passed November 12, 1964.
Stanley Knowles, in conclusion of that debate said:

--we are dealing with the subject matter which for nine decades or more has been a most explosive one. I suppose few issues have generated as much ill-will in parliament as has the question of the redistribution of the seats in the House of Commons.

Mr. Olson, who I believe was from Alberta, said:

--the passage of this bill to set up this commission will indeed be a red letter day and a proud day for parliament.

It was a red letter day. It did end 90 years of gerrymandering and it makes great reading.
Far more important, I urge, I demand, the treasury benches across the way to heed and take heart from what was done in 1964 and agree that the clumsy, unfortunate and totally inappropriate way in which some boundary commissions have been appointed this time, in New Brunswick, Alberta and Saskatchewan in particular in 2002, will never be replicated.",New Democratic Party,Palliser,Dick Proctor,

In my riding, the proposed boundary will be changed in a very significant part of my community called North Dartmouth. It is a community of interest and has historical voting patterns that date back to Confederation, yet the proposal is to change the boundary right down the middle. I have had meetings with people and during the summer we talked about this issue and actually made presentations to the boundary commission. One of the comments made by somebody in those early days struck my heart. It was “What does it matter, because this is just the way it is and this is going to happen anyway”. I was struck by the fact that these people in my community had no confidence that this was an unbiased and fair process.
I want to ask the member for Palliser how he feels. How much damage is done when certain boundary commissions that have been struck seem to have quite a strong connection to the government? How do we redress this damage?",New Democratic Party,Dartmouth,Wendy Lill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=40e50704-8f9f-4468-93fd-1abf14fff088&Language=E&Section=ALL

There is no question that harm is done to democracy when people throw up their hands and say “Oh, well, the government will do whatever the government wishes”.
It is particularly disturbing, as I tried to indicate in my earlier remarks, because successive parliaments following Confederation in 1867 went back and forth on this issue. Whoever was in power had a tremendous opportunity to control the boundaries. The minority Parliament in 1964 dealt with that. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that since 1964, until these latest proposed boundary changes following a census, it seems to have worked fairly well. There has not been a lot of criticism. It looked like the 26th Parliament had done its job well and had eliminated the most blatant aspects.
Now all of a sudden we seem to be going backward. I think that people do wonder what the point is of getting involved in politics. It is the approach of “it does not matter who is elected, the government always wins”, like the old Irish proverb.
We in this caucus still think democracy matters. More important, we think this Parliament and this government ought to understand that it matters a great deal and make sure that what has happened in the boundary changes this time is never again allowed to occur.",New Democratic Party,Palliser,Dick Proctor,

I appreciate what the member had to say in regard to the redistribution process in Saskatchewan.
One of my concerns is that the decisions that were made in regard to electoral boundaries did not follow the natural historic patterns of following municipal boundaries and natural divisions such as rivers. That has had a very negative effect upon the whole process and people's attitude toward it.
I agree with the previous comments. This is very detrimental to the participation of people in the political process. We need to encourage people to participate. What has happened here really flies in the face of that because it is destroying community cohesiveness. Because the commission has gone away from boundaries such as municipal boundaries, this really rips communities in half. It is using highways as a division. Many of these highways go right through the centre of a community so we have one part of the community in one riding and one in another. That just will not work.

Throughout the summer months I have talked to hundreds of people in my riding about issues that concern them. I talked to them at barbecues, on the ferry, on fundraising walks and in my office. Over and over again I heard about the critical state of our health care system. I heard about the dismay and fear caused by waiting lists in emergency rooms, for MRIs, for mammograms, for appointments with specialists and for necessary operations. I heard from people who have lost loved ones and are left to ponder the terrible question, what if they had received the help they needed when they needed it? That is a terrible question to be left with.
In my riding almost daily I also hear about education issues, about the lack of speech therapists and teachers' assistants and social workers. Although I know that these issues are considered provincial issues, I always do whatever I can to move them ahead because investing in young people is of course a national issue. Providing a level playing field for young persons with disabilities is absolutely a federal responsibility and a charter of rights responsibility.
This summer I also heard a great deal about the high cost of post-secondary education from young people, and from their parents who have invested years in their children's schooling. I heard from young people who have dared to dream about future professions and who now are facing incredible costs for post-secondary education. With the federal government's abandonment of its support for post-secondary education, tuition fees have gone up by 135%. Nova Scotia is leading this shameful example.
This summer, with the extreme weather events across the country and across the globe, I also heard concerns about our environment: water quality, air quality and of course our sewage treatment problems.
I have heard from people in North Preston who said they can wait no longer for the three levels of government to come together and help them build their much needed recreation centre.
I have heard much about poverty and substandard housing as well.
At the Battle of Britain ceremonies and at the jetties to meet returning ships, I heard concerns from veterans and many people in the armed forces about the fact that the government continues not to put in the necessary money for the equipment they need to do their job.
So it was with great interest that I listened to the throne speech in hopes that there would be some long awaited good news for the people of Canada.
To begin with, as I just asked the minister a question about this today, I would have to say that unfortunately and outrageously nothing was said in the throne speech about a significant federal commitment to the Halifax harbour cleanup. What is needed and what the NDP has been pressing for since the beginning is for the federal government to commit one-third of the money for such a large environmental infrastructure project, which is what it used to do in the past. That would be about $110 million. Instead, the government followed the lead of the provincial government, the ham-fisted provincial government, with only a token $30 million investment, leaving our city scrambling and our citizens wondering what it is they can expect from the federal government other than lofty words.
Unfortunately, the throne speech was full of lofty words and promises but alarmingly short on how-tos and whens. The unfulfilled promises from the Liberal red book of 1993 and 1996 have reappeared on everything from child poverty to urban renewal.
The throne speech indicated that the Liberals will finally ask Parliament to ratify the Kyoto accord. It was in one slim paragraph, very short on details, with no plan as to how they are going to do this. That is a crime. Because of Liberal stalling, greenhouse gas emissions today are 14% above 1990 levels, about 20% above our Kyoto target. By Health Canada's own admission, 16,000 people die prematurely every year due to environmental pollution.
New Democrats are fighting for action now on Kyoto, not vague promises. We need a solid implementation plan now to reflect the environmental impact on and the technological capability of our economy in terms of the environmental problems we are facing. We need to fight for a ratification plan that is fair to affected regions and to the workers in those regions. To make Kyoto work we need good ideas and legislation and federal commitments now.
The NDP is calling for the legislated creation of a market for ethanol and biomass fuels and for the mandatory conversion of coal-fired energy plants through the enforcement of clean air standards. As well, we are calling for the creation of a national alternative energy strategy, based upon proven capability in wind, solar and tidal production, and, in partnership with the provinces and municipalities, for the federal government to support transportation waste diversion and municipal infrastructure programs that promote energy efficiency and the use of non-fossil fuels. Of course this includes the Halifax harbour cleanup.
Not surprisingly, the throne speech called for much needed work in the health care system. New Democrats welcome a strong and renewed commitment by the federal government to our beleaguered public health care system. We will be watching carefully to make sure that this promise is not broken again. Privatization, long waiting lists for surgery, and woefully inadequate home and long term care: this is the Prime Minister's legacy so far.
The Romanow report due in November is expected to provide a blueprint for a renewed federal role in health care. We believe that this renewed role must include a significant increase in federal funding to the provinces and enforcement of the Canada Health Act to stop the growth of private clinics and hospitals. We also believe that we have to see an introduction of the long promised national pharmacare and home care programs. We will be fighting for those measures and will oppose any “rob Peter to pay Paul” proposals for funding the federal increase to health care transfers.
So far we have seen trial balloons about increasing the GST or further cutting employment insurance to pay for increases in health care funding. Such moves would be unfair and unacceptable. If the Liberals need more revenue for health care and social programs, they should look first at the ill-advised tax cuts contained in the former finance minister's 2000 budget, tax cuts that benefit mainly the banks, the big corporations and the wealthy.
Canadian content was sorely missing in the throne speech and in the Prime Minister's legacy. There was no mention of increased investment in the Canada Council or the CBC. Deep cuts to the CBC have destroyed the public broadcaster's ability to fulfill its mandate for Canadians. For all intents and purposes, CBC regional television news programming has ceased to exist under the Prime Minister's government. Despite all of the recent Liberal rhetoric about redressing the democratic deficit, the throne speech is silent about the critical need for media concentration legislation.
Nor does the throne speech give any comfort to military families that our Sea Kings will be replaced, or to the homeless that there will be affordable housing started before the snow flies.
There are many more people who will be sorely disappointed with the government's direction, but perhaps none more than persons with disabilities. Even as the throne speech puts forward a couple of measures to address disability issues, the finance department is ripping away other much needed income supports. It is instituting unfair and punitive measures to cut people off from the disability tax credit. Canadians with disabilities deserve respect and equal citizenship from their government, not harassing bureaucracies and punitive legislation.
In closing, I would urge the government to follow the calls from the courts, advocacy groups, the medical profession and the disabilities subcommittee and provide humane and compassionate tax relief to our most vulnerable citizens. That would be the most significant and genuine legacy of all.",New Democratic Party,Dartmouth,Wendy Lill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=40e50704-8f9f-4468-93fd-1abf14fff088&Language=E&Section=ALL

Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) (Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), Lib.)",,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,"Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate today. In looking at the time and realizing that we are in day six of the debate, we are close to the conclusion of the House's consideration of the motion in respect to the Speech from the Throne.
We have heard a lot of information, many points of view from all sides of the House about the Speech from the Throne and about the vision the government is putting forward to Canadians and about where we want to take the country over the next several months. It would be appropriate to take a moment to recap what was in the Speech from the Throne and to remind Canadians of the commitments and the ideas that were put forward in that document.
I should begin by making a point which perhaps has been lost a little bit, at least in the parts of the debate that I have heard. That was the commitment in the Speech from the throne to fiscal responsibility.
When the government came to office nine years ago, the country was in debt to the tune of $42 billion. Through the hard effort of Canadians from all walks of life, from all parts of the country, we now operate in a fiscal surplus. We have been able to pay down our debt.
One of the commitments that was made in the Speech from the Throne is that we would not go back into deficit, that we would not take the efforts that Canadians have put forward in all of those years and toss them aside. Yes, there are significant issues that we need to deal with as a government, significant issues that we need to deal with as a country, but we are determined to do it with the same fiscal prudence that has earmarked this government's administration over the last nine years.
I want to say to all Canadians that they can be assured that through the leadership of the Prime Minister, through the leadership of the Minister of Finance, of cabinet and of caucus, we will adhere to that principle.
There were a number of commitments and a number of important issues raised in the Speech from the Throne that we need to deal with as a nation and as Canadians.
Something which I believe will seize Canadians with debate in the not too distant future even more than it has over the last little while is the issue of health care. The Speech from the Throne talked about the issue of health care. It made some very important commitments. It talked about the process Roy Romanow has been undergoing for some time to make some suggestions about how we should reform health care, how we should make sure we have a health care system that is responsive to the needs of Canadians in the 21st century, and the types of things we need to do as the federal government, as provincial governments, and simply as Canadians to reform our health care system.
There were two very important commitments in the Speech from the Throne with respect to that. There was a commitment by the Prime Minister that he would bring together the first ministers from all the provinces and territories shortly in the new year after Mr. Romanow tables his report. They will discuss the actual content of the report and the types of strategies that ought to be undertaken to reform health care. That is the appropriate way to do it.
Health care is the responsibility of the provinces. Also there is a federal responsibility involved in it. Quite frankly, from Canadians' perspective, from what I have heard in my community and as I have travelled around the country, Canadians want all governments collectively to work together to resolve health care.
There was also another very important commitment in the Speech from the Throne. The Prime Minister said that after those consultations and those discussions with the provinces, we will make the necessary investments in order to have a sustainable health care system in the 21st century. That is something Canadians view as a priority and it was in the Speech from the Throne.
The second pillar that was discussed in the Speech from the Throne was Canada's place in the world. That is an important issue for Canadians. It is an important issue for the family of nations.
One of the commitments was that we would continue to work as we have in the past year in response to the tragic events of September 11 a year ago and that we would deal with security issues as we have in the last 13 months. We will work with our American allies both in terms of multilateral issues around the globe, but also in our bilateral issues dealing with issues on the border.
The Minister of Finance in his role with respect to security relationships with the United States signed a border protocol with Governor Ridge. It outlined many important steps that we would be undertaking in order to ensure not only that we have a secure border, because that is important, but also that we have a border that is effective in terms of the commerce that takes place between our two countries.
In talking about our place in the world an important component of it is the commitment to increase international assistance as a member of the family of nations. We are one of the family of nations that is fortunate in terms of the wealth we have been able to achieve as Canadians. We have a responsibility to others in the world who have not been as fortunate. Through our international aid program we are exercising that responsibility. I was pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne a commitment to continue to do that and in fact to continue to do it at increased levels.
The Speech from the Throne also spoke clearly to the issues surrounding the Africa agenda and making sure that we move forward with that.
The third pillar was in terms of the environment and a commitment to deal with those environmental challenges we face as Canadians. This is an important issue for all Canadians. It is a particularly important issue for rural Canadians as they deal with many of the issues as stewards of our natural environment. I was pleased to see the commitments. I was pleased to see the Prime Minister commit to the Kyoto accord.
We heard the opposition say that we need a made in Canada solution. I think I heard one of the members from Alberta say, “Kyoto isn't in Canada; it is in some far away country”.
We may have arrived at the objectives collectively as a group of nations. We may have met in Kyoto to come to the conclusion as to what those objectives will be. However the made in Canada part, the part that is essential, is how we go about achieving it in our nation. That is a made in Canada solution that will be made by the government. It will be made collectively in the House by Canadian parliamentarians through consultations and input from the provinces through consultations and input from business, from other organizations in society. Indeed it will be made collectively as Canadians.
It will be a made in Canada solution to achieve an objective and a goal that was collectively arrived at by the family of nations. That is an appropriate approach. Any suggestion that what we are going to do is something that is not a Canadian initiative is simply not accurate.
Also included in the Speech from the Throne was the issue of dealing with our children and those children who live in poverty and the importance as a government to take steps to alleviate child poverty.
One of the unique things the government has done was the creation of the national child benefit. That instrument has been very successful in alleviating poverty among children. It has not been eliminated. There is much that still needs to be done. There is more that needs to be accomplished, but it is a good initiative.
I was pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne that we are going to continue to build on that initiative. We are going to enrich the child benefit to make sure that even more and more Canadians have an opportunity to utilize and take advantage of that program. There are also commitments in terms of access to additional child care benefit and increasing it.
I was pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne, and I think I am probably joined by all members in the House, a commitment to increase criminal penalties for those who would abuse our children. I am sure that as that legislation comes forward from the Minister of Justice all members in the House will see that as an important legislative commitment that we need to deal with.
The Speech from the Throne also dealt with the issue of communities, the importance of having strong communities and the importance of ensuring that Canadians, whether they live in urban communities or in rural communities, have an opportunity for an increased standard of living and an improved quality of life. That was a clear and concise commitment in the Speech from the Throne. We are determined as a government to bring forward measures that will help us accomplish that objective. Some of those measures were suggested in the Speech from the Throne.
I was particularly pleased to see the commitment to a new national infrastructure program, a 10 year commitment to infrastructure for communities in things like transportation, environmental infrastructure and telecommunications infrastructure. All of these are critical.
As I have travelled around the country in my role as Secretary of State for Rural Development, one of the things that municipal leaders have said to me was that although they were very appreciative of the government's infrastructure programs in the past, that it was absolutely necessary to have some certainty and some sort of clarity so they could see how they should budget in the future and how they should do their commitments.
That is why I think it is particularly important in the Speech from the Throne to see a 10 year commitment to an infrastructure program so we can work in partnership, where the opportunities present themselves, with provincial governments and the municipalities to do some long term planning and deal with some of the infrastructure deficit that exists in the country. I was particularly pleased, in my role as Secretary of State for Rural Development, to see a commitment to do some of this infrastucture in the rural parts of the country.
I should also say that I was pleased, in looking at the Speech from the Throne and hearing the Speech from the Throne, to see some very specific commitments in respect of rural Canada and the needs of rural Canada.
First, we saw a commitment to implement the agricultural policy framework and the related measures that would give rise to that policy framework. That is something that I know members on this side have worked hard to develop. It was something that I know members of the opposition have often said that we need a long term vision in agriculture and that we need to know where we are going in agriculture.
I was pleased to be with the Prime Minister this past June when he announced the $5.2 billion toward the agricultural policy framework and related measures, and particularly pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne a commitment that we would continue to implement that.
I was pleased to see the discussion about regional development agencies and the importance of changing the programming in our regional development agencies in a way that will deal with the knowledge-based economy, with innovation and with learning. I think that is an appropriate approach for our regional development agencies. That is particularly important for the rural components of the country. I am so pleased to see a commitment to deal with our regional development agencies.
The infrastructure program, as I mentioned, is one that will also have very significant and positive impacts on rural Canada.
One of the smaller mentions in the Speech from the Throne, but a very important one from a rural perspective, is the work on two very large projects in rural Canada that will create or have significant job creation opportunities and also add significantly to the economic well-being of the country. In the east, it will assist with the development of Voisey's Bay to make sure that we have an opportunity to see that project move forward, to see the wealth that will be created in an area of the country that has historically had some challenges in creating wealth, and to see the jobs that will flow out of that wealth creation. I am pleased to see that commitment in the Speech from the Throne.
I am pleased to see the commitment toward assisting with the development and construction of our northern pipeline. This will help create jobs and wealth in a part of the country that historically has had more difficulty in creating that wealth.
Another pillar in the Speech from the Throne is the commitments toward our aboriginal communities, something to which the government has long had a commitment and something to which I know the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has had a lifelong commitment. This is important, not just for Canada as a whole, but it has a particular resonance in rural Canada where many of our aboriginal communities are situated. We need to provide assistance and the legislative framework.
I was pleased when the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development tabled a bill last June in terms of governance, which will be brought back into the second session of Parliament. I think that is an important issue.
The Speech from the Throne also talks about rural issues and rural commitments. It is important for all members to understand, and I believe they do, that the challenges rural Canada faces are different than those faced by urban Canada, which is why it is particularly important that we see specific initiatives that are undertaken in respect to rural Canada.
If we think about those challenges, we have the issue of geography. One of the realities is that when we operate in rural Canada there is a great deal of geography. This is one of the reasons that many of us live in rural Canada. However that does create some challenges in terms of delivering government services and private sector services. Therefore programming has to be delivered in a rural context differently than in an urban context to deal with the issue of geography.
In terms of rural Canada we tend to have low population densities as compared to some of our large urban centres. That is an important difference. In a large urban centre where there are high population densities, the private sector may be willing to make those infrastructure investments totally on their own.
That same investment will happen in a rural area, particularly in terms of infrastructure, which all Canadians should have an opportunity to have access to. It is critical sometimes to have a private-public sector partnership to see those kinds of investments take place. That is why it is really important that we take into account that particular difference between our urban and rural areas and that we develop a policy that reflects those differences.
There is the whole issue of distance from markets. When we operate in a rural area very often there are larger distances to go to our marketplaces. I know members on the other side have talked about this, but when we want to encourage value adding to our natural resource industries we need to make sure that the distance to markets can be overcome so that these types of value added industries can be created in our rural communities.
So we often need to undertake policies in respect of, for instance, infrastructure to make sure we can overcome those distances. The initiative that the Minister of Industry announced not too long ago, the broadband initiative, will help ensure that there is broadband high speed Internet access to our rural communities.",Liberal,Parry Sound--Muskoka,Andy Mitchell,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=0d931d45-6a50-4119-9243-ce2961f43841&Language=E&Section=ALL

Andy Mitchell,,Speech from the Throne,Resumption of debate on Address in Reply,,"The chap across the way says that it is already there. Well, I know he has to challenge sometimes to keep up with things so I will give him a hand with that. I imagine our television audience would also want to know this. I want to inform the House that there are 4,100 rural communities today that continue not to have access to high speed Internet. That diminishes their access to important things such as health care, education and lifelong learning and a competitive business environment.
That is why it is so important to have a Liberal government that understands there are differences between urban and rural Canada, that understands that if we are to be successful as a nation we need to have both a strong urban and rural component because we cannot move forward unless both parts of this nation are strong. We in rural Canada depend on urban Canada and urban Canada depends on rural Canada.

I hate to see people out there left with this sour taste in their mouths after six days of throne speech debate, so I will try to get some clear thinking going here.
The member touched on high speed Internet for everybody. There is not a community from Tuktoyaktuk to Timmins that does not have a satellite dish or the availability of satellite television or cable television. Programs are already there. This is a huge duplication. That really concerns us on this side of the House, and a lot of the backbenchers over there too. There are no nickels and dimes attached to this huge wish list that the government calls a throne speech. That is the biggest problem with this type of directive. Where is the budget? How will the money be allocated for all these glorious, wonderful nine years of a wish list that has been put together?
