The St. Catharines Booth Centre, formerly the Salvation Army Men's Social Service Centre, opened its doors in 1952 to provide for the physical, spiritual and emotional needs of individuals over the age of 18, regardless of origin.
The centre has grown with the community to meet its changing needs. The centre now is a combined halfway house and hostel and offers a total of 33 bed spaces to those in need. It also offers meals, clothing, counselling, referral and recreational services, a volunteer chaplaincy at the Niagara Detention Centre, a court support program at the St. Catharines courthouse and a family tracing service which helps to locate immediate family members who have lost touch and wish to be reunited.
I would like to thank Major Henry Jewer, the staff and all the volunteers of the St. Catharines Booth Centre for 50 years of caring and compassionate service to the community. I know the Booth Centre looks forward to providing its valuable service for many years to come.",Liberal,St. Catharines,Walt Lastewka,

If the government implements the Kyoto protocol it will be a devastating blow for many farmers.
The government has imposed a wheat board monopoly on farmers, only farmers on the Prairies keep in mind, so that some are being sent to jail for selling their own wheat. Drought has hit farmers unbelievably hard over the past few years. The port of Vancouver now has been left closed by the government and nothing has been done about that. Unfair trade in other countries has driven prices down so that farmers are getting paid well below prices paid to their competitors.
Now there is Kyoto, which does nothing for pollution but which would drive up prices for things like fuel, fertilizer and pesticides which our farmers pay. All will go up substantially. How much? The government does not know, yet it is going to ratify. It seems like it simply does not care.

One of the winners was in my city. The University of Manitoba and Calgary based Canadian Bio-Systems Inc. earned their award for their joint efforts in improving enzymes added to animal feed.

These restrictions are too severe. Both potato wart and the mop-top potato virus are soil borne and if potatoes are cleaned neither virus will spread. Neighbouring farms that are tested and found to be virus free should not have to face trade restrictions.

As someone who was here in this House before Gus Cloutier arrived, it is a privilege for me to join with the members of the Progressive Conservative Party in paying tribute to him today.
He has been a distinguished Canadian public servant for 50 years. It is extraordinary to have spent that much time and given that much quality of service to the country.
As has been noted before, Major General Cloutier joined the Royal Canadian Air Force 50 years ago in 1952. He came to the House in 1978 as Sergeant-at-Arms. He has given outstanding service here, not simply on the questions of procedure and of ceremonies as has been said, but also as a master of thousands of day to day details.
If I may say so, Gus, on behalf of several of my colleagues present and parted, among your other qualities, we appreciate your discretion.
The House leader of the New Democratic Party made reference to the sword that Gus Cloutier carries as Sergeant-at-Arms. He and I had the same thought and so did my normal seatmate, the member for Saint John. We know how well prepared Gus Cloutier is for most things and we were concerned that in a moment of surprise he might draw that mighty sword and clean these benches.
The member for Saint John has taken the course of prudence and is expressing her good wishes to you from a safe distance, Gus. She also said to me that she thought, thinking about the sword, if you were to draw it, given your responsibilities to Her Majesty the Queen, it would probably be directed at the Deputy Prime Minister and not at anyone else here.
This is a place of rules and at the end of the day the Sergeant-at-Arms is the officer who enforces them. What has characterized Gus Cloutier's service to the House has been that while he is a respecter of the rules, he is not at all their prisoner. He has always found ways to facilitate the work of members of Parliament while retaining the dignity of this institution. In a word, he has been a friend of the member of this House. He makes this House of Commons work.
We are celebrating your service today not simply, Gus, on the basis of the length of service but of the high quality of that service and of your sensitivity to the life and nature of this institution.

My thanks to the Leader of the Government in the House, the Minister of National Defence, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services for their contributions to the discussion.
The essence of the argument of the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke is that the response given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence for her inquiry about funding for the Canadian Emergency Preparedness College was deliberately misleading.
I have carefully considered the arguments put forward by the hon. member, as well as those made by other members. I can find no evidence that would suggest that a breach of privilege has occurred. Rather, it appears to me that a dispute as to facts exists and that the matter would no doubt more properly be pursued by the hon. member through debate in the usual manner, whether in question period or elsewhere.

It has particularly dealt with Standing Order 31 statements where reference by members to people in the gallery is disruptive and of course loses time so we do not get as many S.O. 31 statements as we might otherwise have.
I listened to the question and the answer today. I must say I do not recall, and had I heard the minister make some reference to people in the gallery, I would have been on my feet in a flash. However, I will check the blues and I will in fact look at the videotape of the proceedings to see if there was some hint. I sensed that there were people in the gallery; I detected that there was talk of people in the navy being particularly thanked, but I did not think the minister either pointed or said they were there. However, I will check the blues and if necessary, I will chastise the minister.
This is not a matter that makes a speaker quail, and the hon. member for Edmonton North knows that, but I think it is very important that we bear this in mind.
Yesterday there were references to people who had just left the gallery, which I found troubling, and references to the people who were coming into the gallery later, which I found troubling because I had a feeling they might have already been there.
I urge hon. members to respect our traditions and avoid these kinds of references in their remarks. We are functioning as a House here on this level. The people who are in the heavens, up higher, are not necessarily ones we ought to refer to in the course of our debate.

As the Speaker will know, this new convention we have of having these announcements from the Chair was made pursuant to recommendation No. 37 of the modernization committee report. The modernization committee report stated that moving up the notice requirement should facilitate the preparation for debate, including the scheduling of speakers. Mr. Speaker will no doubt be familiar with the entirety of that recommendation.
It has been drawn to my attention that two motions have been asked to be placed on the order paper for tomorrow. Before the Speaker announces which one of those motions, in the unlikely event that the Speaker would announce that there are two of them, I want to draw to the attention of Mr. Speaker that the modernization committee report, later translated into the standing order, had as an objective to ensure that members knew precisely the topic being raised the following day in the House. Listing two, three, four, or next week, six dozen items would effectively prevent members of Parliament from having the benefit of that information which was contained in the modernization committee report which was adopted unanimously by this House of Commons.
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, as you prepare to tell us what the item is for debate tomorrow, I would like to call upon the Chair to ensure that there is only one item that is brought to our attention and in so doing, the letter and the intention of the modernization committee report will be respected.

(b) committee members wishing to indicate their choice for Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the committee shall print the first and last names of the candidate on the ballot paper;
(c) the committee members shall deposit their completed ballot papers in a box provided for that purpose;
(d) the clerk of the committee shall count the ballots and announce the name of the candidate who has received the majority of votes;
(e) if no candidate has received a majority of votes, a second ballot shall be taken, provided that the candidate with the least number of votes shall be dropped from the second ballot; balloting shall continue in this manner until a candidate receives the majority of votes, at which time the clerk shall destroy the ballots and in no way divulge the number of ballots cast for any candidate.”;

Too many times frontline officers and parole officials have been warned and individuals should not be turned back to society since they are a danger to offend. The bill would prevent that from happening.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-279, an act to amend the Criminal Code (bail for those charged with violent offences).

Mr. Speaker, the bill would permit a person who has been accused of sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault or criminal harassment, who has been identified by the victim or by a witness to the offence, from being released on bail.
The result would be that the accused could not be released unless the charge was withdrawn or the accused was acquitted at trial.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-280, an act to amend the Criminal Code (selling wildlife).

Mr. Speaker, I would like to reintroduce this bill. The bill is in the same form as the previous Bill C-292 at the time of prorogation, albeit certain sections of the previous bill have been removed as they made reference to sections of statutes that are no longer in force. Therefore, pursuant to Standing Order 86.1, I ask that this bill be reinstated at the same stage it was in when the first session of this Parliament prorogued.
The purpose of this bill is to make the selling of wildlife and wildlife parts an offence under the Criminal Code unless carried under and in accordance with a licence, permit or an exemption order. The sale of threatened or endangered species or their parts would attract an increased penalty. Such offences would also be subject to the money laundering provision of the Criminal Code.

As I said before, I am the chair of our national rural caucus and I would like to give the House a perspective of what we as rural Canadians experience with health care. Right now almost 30% of the population is spread out over 95% of the land area. There are proportionately more seniors in rural Canada. Rural Canada has only 50% as many physicians per thousand people as urban Canada. The average rural citizen lives 10 kilometres away from a doctor, compared to two kilometres for the average urban resident. Approximately 7% of rural residents live more than 25 kilometres from a doctor. Of the 16,000 people who live in the northern regions, two-thirds live over 100 kilometres away from a doctor.
I have talked before about how important it is that we get things as transparent as possible, and this is going to come down to a dollar figure. This is the issue I want to raise. First, did the federal government and the provincial governments ever split health care costs fifty-fifty? The answer is no. In the early 1970s, only doctors and hospital services costs were split fifty-fifty, and when costs of other health care services that the provinces chose to include in their insurance program, such as home care in some provinces, were added up, the federal contribution was about 40%.
Is it accurate to say that the current federal contribution to health care is 14%? Again, the answer is no. The provinces arrived at this percentage by counting some of the federal moneys and not others. They are not counting the Canada health and social transfer tax points, the equalization payments they receive from the federal government or direct health care spending by the federal government.
Next we would have to ask, what are tax points? Tax points were established in 1977. They are a direct transfer of tax collection to provinces. This means that the federal government lowered its tax rate and allowed provincial governments to raise their rates by the same amount. The result? More taxes flowed directly to provincial coffers. There was no change in the amount of taxes paid by Canadians. The change was the destination: from the federal coffers to the provincial coffers. Since these tax points were never transferred back to the federal government, provincial governments continue to benefit from them. In fact, in 2001-02, the tax points given to provincial governments amount to nearly $16.3 billion.
How much money does the Government of Canada spend on health care? Currently the Government of Canada spends money on health care in two ways: first, through transfer to the provinces and the territories which I have already partially described; and second, through direct spending and tax credits. Basically, that money goes directly to aboriginals, Inuit, Canadian veterans and the Canadian Forces. Transfers to the provinces and the territories are federal money transfers to the provinces through the CHST cash and tax points and through equalization payments.
Then transparency burns down to this, I believe. We must sit down with the provinces and come up with a fair, equitable, transparent system that we all agree to. Clearly to me and I hope clearly to the House, there is a heck of a lot of politics being played with this right now. Quite frankly, I think it is unconscionable to start playing politics with Canada's health care system, given the fact, as I have stated before, that by 2020-24, 25% of our population will be 65 and older. It is imperative that we get an agreement between the feds and the provinces as to how we are going to get this system running and running properly.
We have a Senate report and the Romanow report will be coming out. I would hope that these two reports will give us the basis, as a government at the federal level and governments at the provincial level, to come to some sort of agreement as to how this system is to work.
I would hope, and I will be watching, to be involved in the debate and negotiations as to how this will work.",Liberal,Dufferin--Peel--Wellington--Grey,Murray Calder,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=36af9837-2ccf-4e77-92df-f268abb0fdc4&Language=E&Section=ALL
4228771,ca.proc.d.2002-10-30.1689.172,2002-10-30,3414fb56-c9d7-4a95-8cef-87d72a864e04,197,"Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.)",,Government Orders,Health Care System,,"Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey for sharing his time with me. Obviously there will be much debate in the process of take note on how we would like to see the evolving health care system transform itself in Canada. Obviously we have plenty to work on and as we speak there are significant changes occurring, and there are different components of our health care system which are leading to a cost-push scenario.
I cannot think of one that is more near and dear to the hearts of Canadians and is one that Canadians readily understand and are facing. However it is also something which is really responsible for the second largest portion of their bills. The Canadian Institute for Health Information pointed out recently that drug retail sales are now the second largest category of spending. Our health care system is spending more on drugs in this nation than we do on doctors.
It is not surprising that this is occurring and therefore I want to confine my remarks strictly to what I believe to be the underlying concern driving the rising cost of pharmaceuticals.
I am not talking about doing away with the 20-year patent protection period. It is already provided to create an environment where we have expensive brand name pharmaceuticals. I am not talking about removing Canada from its international obligations as outlined under the WTO or the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property rights.
I am talking about the spurious use of regulations attached to the Patent Act with respect to patented medicines. The regulations permit brand name companies and manufacturers to use automatic injunctions to keep much cheaper generic drugs off the market, even upon expiration of the 20-year patent protection period to which we have agreed, by simply claiming that their patent is being infringed. I point out that it is simply a claim.
Automatic injunctions are heinous, odious and an affront to our legal system. They are also a major cause behind the high cost of prescription drugs in Canada because by simply claiming infringement an automatic injunction is granted to a brand name manufacturer. The generic company which has the opportunity to bring its product on-line then has to face lengthy and prolonged court battles to clear the infringement case. Even though the courts dismiss well over 80% of the claims, the financial damage has already been done. The case has achieved the target of clearly delaying cheaper drugs from getting onto store shelves and obviously reducing the pocket books of those who need drugs, not because it is a fashionable thing but because they are sick.
Equally important, lengthy court cases virtually guarantee what amounts to an extended patent, an extension that goes well beyond the already provided for 20-year patent protection period. The use of the automatic injunction provision is more than not a deliberate and frivolous misuse of regulations. It provides an extended financial benefit to the brand name pharmaceutical companies and Canadians and Canada's health care system pay dearly for that.
That is why automatic injunctions, in my view and I think the view of a growing number of people in Canada, and certainly in the United States, is that they must be done away with.
What is the cost of delaying the entry onto the market of cheaper generic drugs? What is the cost to an already overburdened provincial and federal health care system? What is the cost to consumers? Most important, what is the cost to those people on low incomes, to those seniors who have paid and have to make the decision as to whether or not they wish to eat, pay the rent or buy expensive prescription drugs so they can simply live?
Not all Canadians have prescription drug coverage. I can assure the House that for too many Canadians it does not come down to having to make any financial decisions as to whether or not they can afford to fill prescriptions. Such incidents are not acceptable. Only Canada and the United States provide for this regime of automatic injunctions.
However, in the past 10 days to 12 days, the U.S. is taking action to limit the use of automatic injunctions. For example, President Bush stated in the last week or so that no multiple 30-month patent infringement claims will be from this point forward be permitted.
The so-called use of evergreening, applying for a new patent just because the shape of the pill has been changed or a new non-medicinal ingredient has been added, will not be allowed to continue in the United States.
As Americans prepare for their mid-term elections on November 5, drug costs and the actions of the multinational drug companies have inundated the political ads on TV, and the need for lower drug costs has become quite clearly a major election issue. With efforts underway in the United States senate and the house of representatives to address automatic injunctions and evergreening, Canada will soon become literally the only country in the world that permits such a disgusting and expensive activity. Given the tobacco issue last year and the Cipro case, it should be clear to everyone now that the multinational pharmaceutical companies only have the proverbial bottom line as their interest and not the health of Canadians.
The Kirby report on health just this last Friday accurately pointed out at least one thing. In recent years the cost of prescription drugs has escalated faster than all the other elements of health care, to support what CIHI had said just a little earlier. Why is this so? Why do we see these increases? Why do we permit this heavy burden to be applied to the provincial drug formularies, to Canadian seniors, to low income Canadians and to those who do not have a prescription drug plan?
There are some people who are turning to the debate on patent protection, and automatic injunctions in particular, into a question of regionalism. They argue that to remove injunctions would pit one region against another, as the brand name companies are primarily headquartered on the island of Montreal, for instance, and generic companies are located in Ontario. Anything that cuts into existing provisions that could extend the patent would damage Quebec's pharmaceutical industry and, yes, they even argue that some of these same companies would leave Quebec and Canada altogether.
For the record, I have three brand name pharmaceuticals in my riding. I have no generics. However I have an interest for the 137,000 constituents I represent.
I can assure the House or for that matter any party that there are people in regions across Canada, whether it be Saskatchewan or Quebec, who are living on low incomes or who are elderly. I am sure most over time will get ill and will require prescription drugs at some point in their lives. This is not therefore and should not be in any way, shape or form a political issue.
Understandably there are some who want to make it that debate. Clearly we do not. Certainly on the industry committee in the last session, it was clear that the committee wanted to tackle the issue of automatic injunctions. At some point it will.
Some parties in the House like to call themselves staunch defenders of democracy and will always stand up for a region's interests. At the same time, as the past indicates, they defend multinational manufacturers by not demanding the end of automatic injunctions. We cannot have it both ways.
Clearly other issues have to be brought into consideration. Losac, which is used for ulcers, is one of the largest drugs used in Canada and the United States. It has now been caught in a legal web in Canada for nearly four years. The price is for this drug is too high, as recognized not only by governments in the United States and Canada, but by manufacturers and unions. Why are we paying it? Simply because we want to protect a regulation under the notice of compliance that was passed in 1992 without the consent of the committee and which slipped through at the last moment by Parliament. If we want to talk about a regulation that is doing much to undermine the credibility of our system, this is one.
We have given the brand name pharmaceuticals 20 years of patent protection. We did this for their efforts and expense to research and create new innovative drugs. There is no doubt that brand name pharmaceutical companies should receive revenue for their work. However I still do not understand how TV ads can be included as part of the research and development costs under our tax act.
Nonetheless the brand companies deserve fair compensation for their investments. Fairness, it would appear, is a two-way street. Nowhere is it acceptable to use a government provided regulatory measure to gain additional revenues, especially when a guaranteed 20 year patent exists.
With the exception of the United States, we understand that every other WTO country does not permit automatic injunctions. Clearly, why should Canada? It is time for us to act to ensure that cheaper prescription drugs are made available on the pharmacy shelves of this nation.

I noticed that he confined his comments to the issue of drug costs and generic drugs versus ones that are protected by patent. While I agree it is of very real concern to all Canadians, because of the escalating costs of drugs, there are alternatives and I want to briefly address them.
One thing I believe is inherently wrong with the way the federal government is looking at the health care system right now is that it is not viewing health care with sufficient flexibility. By that I mean we have to take a new look at this in the sense of preventive versus reactive medicine. There is a lot of new technology. However some is old technology which we have not accepted in our culture and country, whether it is naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic or things like that. Some would argue that these alternatives would give Canadians greater choice in their health care. In other words, it would be a patient driven system whereby they could make those choices and have money available for those types of alternatives. This would give more choice to Canadians.
While I recognize that the cost of drugs is a huge issue that we must address as a government and as Parliament, would the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge agree that, as we move through this debate on health care, it is really necessary for us to look at this within the confines of the Canada Health Act and allow as much flexibility as possible, and look at other alternatives which would be more preventive in nature versus reactive in treating disease and pain once they have already occurred in the patient?",Canadian Alliance,Prince George--Peace River,Jay Hill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=5c079946-a5d3-4808-819f-f7b9e073f5a3&Language=E&Section=ALL

However we have to recognize that we have an aging population.
We have to ensure that, while there are private companies involved in the delivery of a universal health care system, we do not invite a NAFTA challenge on the question of investment. We do not want to put ourselves in the position where we break away from the five principles, but we have to recognize the real context of what is causing and undermining our health care system.

First, does the hon. member think there have been examples of abuse of the patent rule, pushing it beyond 20 years?
Second, with the U.S. now coming into line with the rest of the world to stop this abuse, will that make it easier for us to get this through Canada?
The hard question is this.

The example is that the United States, which of course is home to many of the national brand name manufacturers for which Canada is home to none except for the warehouses and our generic industry, has already demonstrated that this abuse must stop. Senator McCain and Senator Schumer led the charge in the United States. In Canada our industry committee tried to do the same. Unfortunately there seems to be a deliberate attempt not to try to tackle the real issues.
I know the hon. member finds this interesting. There are some in this House who may want to suggest that generic drugs are more expensive in Canada than anywhere else in the world. They are 400% less in Canada than they are in the United States after we take into account the difference in the dollar valuation. That is as a result of what happened 20 to 30 years ago when we brought in the ability for compulsory licensing.

That this House take note of the on-going public discussion of the future of the Canadian health care system.

We are dealing with an unfortunate situation. After several weeks of debate following the Speech from the Throne, the federal government, lacking leadership, has proposed a debate that is meaningless, because we are beyond the stage of government action.
The mere fact that we are talking about the on-going public discussion of the health care system, claiming that there is a Canadian health care system, reflects a problem with existing jurisdictions, with provincial and federal responsibilities.
It is important that we be aware that there is an urgent need to take action in health care, a need to ensure that there will be funds available and that services will be delivered as efficiently as possible.
However, we were hoping that this government would move beyond this situation, would take into consideration the various reports that it has received and that it would take a stand. If it would prefer to wait for the Romanow report, it should do so. But imposing this type of debate, at this time, demonstrates a lack of leadership on the part of the government.
However, since we are being given this opportunity, we will indicate which are the important elements we should be considering.
Senator Kirby, the chair of a Senate committee, tabled a report. He proposed health care funding solutions, including a new tax, or an increase in the GST, to fund the health care system. We find this unacceptable.
Currently, Quebec and the other provinces agree unanimously that there is a fiscal imbalance between the provincial governments and the federal government. The solution to this fiscal imbalance is not to tax people more heavily.
The federal government must stick to its own jurisdiction and free up the available money in order to ensure adequate health care services in every province, in every region and in every municipality.
At the end of the day, whether it be where I come from in La Pocatière, or in Rivière-du-Loup, or in Abitibi, or anywhere in Quebec or Canada, this is the situation right now.
A part of the problem stems from chronic underfunding of health care, given new variables that we are experiencing, such as the aging of the population.
The federal government does not need to hold more take note debates on the matter. It needs to take action to ensure that, indeed, more funding is provided to the provinces so as to produce more positive results.
In 2000-01 for example, federal transfers accounted for only 16% of revenues in Quebec, as compared to 28% in 1983-84.
This drop in the funding provided through federal transfers forces the provinces to make choices. At present, discussions are taking place within Quebec, where the political parties will be putting forward various options. The fundamental problem is that we must make choices based on funding that is insufficient, because the federal government, as tax collector, collects more money than it really needs. It then uses the excess for other things, when this money should go to the provinces, to be put toward health for instance.
So, while health costs skyrocketed and its revenues increased, the federal government reduced transfers to the provinces, causing the fiscal imbalance we are experiencing , which affects the health care sector.This imbalance is jeopardizing social and economic programs in Quebec.
At this rate, all decisions would be made in Ottawa. Clearly, this is part of a strategy which, with the Romanow report and the Kirby report, will force us increasingly to accept federal interference. This is an increasingly common approach because of the money available. It imposes restrictions on what the provinces can do, when the expertise and know-how in heath is in the provinces. It already exists. What the provinces need more than anything else is to get the funding that would allow them to do proper work in that area.
Coming back to the report of the Kirby committee, this committee concluded that there were only two ways to ensure funding for the health care system and to make it viable. The first one is to increase the GST by 1.5%, from 7% to 8.5%, and the second, to have taxpayers pay, through the tax system, a national health care premium, the amount of which would depend on each person's taxable income.
In my opinion, both solutions need to be rejected. What is needed instead is the courage to find out how much is needed, and to accept the fact that transfer payments will be made to the provinces in greatest need of funds. Moreover, the hon. member for Joliette, who is the Bloc Quebecois finance critic, has made it clear that the Kirby report recommended an increase in federal funding for health care. This may be praiseworthy in itself, because it is in line with what Quebec and the provinces have been calling for, but the means to that end are irresponsible.
We all know that more money is needed for health, that the federal government has that money in its coffers, and that it needs to agree to give it to the provinces. The choices around this may be painful ones. It is true that the debt needs to be paid down. There needs to be a specific plan for reducing the debt. At the same time, when responsibilities within Canada are not assumed, society's needs are not being properly served, and the needs as far as health is concerned are great.
On the other hand, the Romanow commission report seems to be in favour of the imposition of uniform standards and objectives. In this regard, the Romanow commission is announcing that there will be a single Canadian vision, when the constitution says that health is a provincial responsibility. By means of this Canada-wide commission, the federal government will succeed in imposing standards for all of Canada and attempt to develop expertise in an area in which it has none at present.
One of the reasons for doing this is that, internationally, the federal government needs to answer for the health programs in place in Canada. Lacking expertise as it does, rather than allow the provinces to participate in the international fora and to accompany it when international agreements relating to health policies are being discussed, it is trying to acquire expertise and make itself the sole interlocutor on the international level. This is an approach that has no future and one that ought not to be pursued.
Again, as regards the report of the Romanow commission, we are waiting to see its vision for the future. However, it is rather clear that the report will recommend the establishment of a broad primary care system that would be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
This recommendation is already included in the Clair report. What is the Clair commission? As strange as it may seem, we currently have a federal commission, the Romanow commission. However, in Quebec, we had the Clair commission. That commission did somewhat similar work, dealt with all sorts of issues relating to health, and made recommendations. The Romanow commission is clear evidence of unjustified duplication, with the result that a lot of money was once again spent ineffectively.
The federal government should accept the fundamental principle of the existence of a fiscal imbalance in health. This is a historical reality. Indeed, the debate on the issue of transfer payments and the provinces' responsibility regarding health is not new, far from it.
We were told that as early as the end of World War II, the first seeds of disagreement regarding this issue were more than obvious.
In 1942, Ottawa invoked the war effort to impose tax agreements on the provinces. Since then, the federal government has never really withdrawn from these areas. We had the act that includes the five principles regarding health: universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public administration of the system. These principles are now in jeopardy, because of the pressures on our health system. However, one of the main reasons why these five principles are in jeopardy can be summarized by the following question: Do we have the necessary money to meet these objectives? The answer is no, because of the fiscal imbalance that exists all across Canada and which really hurts the whole system.
It has also been obvious that the federal contribution is melting away, like snow on a sunny day. For some years now, since the early 1980s in fact, federal transfer payments have accounted for a smaller and smaller share of the Government of Quebec's revenues. In 2000-01, we are told that this share represented only 16% of Quebec's revenues, whereas it represented over 28% in 1983-84. This federal share of health expenditures, or rather this decrease, has as the obvious result that we are experiencing what amounts to a withdrawal. For example, the percentage of Quebec's health spending covered by federal contributions is expected to drop from 22% in 1993-94 to under 13% in 2005-06, or close to 9 percentage points in just over a decade.
The federal government needs to reverse its direction totally and make substantial investments in this sector.
The federal government will, of course, deny that it is contributing so little, by using the argument of tax points. It considers the tax room it transferred to the provinces in 1967 to be an integral part of its contribution to provincial social programs.
The tax points transferred to the provinces do not, however, constitute a form of federal assistance, nor any kind of manifestation of its spending power. They are, in actual fact, a tax rebalancing mechanism that has always been part of the federation, and have absolutely nothing to do with the Canada social transfer. The reason the federal government transferred tax points to the provinces in the 1960s was to restore to the provinces part of the tax room they had handed over to the federal level in the early 1940s to finance the war effort. This argument does not stand up to scrutiny, therefore, regardless of how it is defended by the federal government.
In the past, there was much talk along the lines of “The Government of Quebec is a government of sovereignists, and that is why it is so critical of the federal government. It is asking for far too much”.
With regard to health care, that argument falls short, because every province in Canada is upset about the federal government pulling out of health care funding. In August 2001, at a meeting in Victoria, the premiers reached a consensus and agreed that Ottawa should provide adequate funding for health care. They came to an agreement on the following measures: first, that the federal contribution to health care increase from 14% to its 1994 level of 18%; second, that the $10 billion ceiling on equalization payments be removed.
The premiers showed their good will. They met twice in 2002 to develop an action plan to improve the management of their own health care systems.The House should remember that the provinces were often criticized and told that federal funding was not the only problem and that they had to make their health care systems more effective and efficient. Efforts have been made in this regard. In fact, provinces have done and are doing their homework so that the problem can eventually be resolved.
However, federal funding is crucial if we are to get rid of the current fiscal imbalance.
One of the reasons for the current fiscal imbalance is that the provinces cannot shirk their social obligations in order to reduce their spending. Provincial jurisdictions affect quasi-daily activities, whether it be welfare, health, or transportation. Budget cuts can hardly be made in these areas, which require a lot of money.
The federal government has other kinds of responsibilities that could be reduced without necessarily affecting its effectiveness.
It is mainly its visibility that would be affected. Since the federal government has a lot of money, it often has a tendency to spend money in areas under provincial jurisdiction because it makes it more visible. That is what the federal government is looking for, but it does not necessarily have a positive impact on what the public wants.
One of the main problems is that, if people try to assess the accountability of each level of government in the area of health care, they will have a hard time figuring it all out.
This situation has to be clarified so that the responsibility of those who have the money is also the responsibility of those who provide the services. This way, the public would be able to assess whether or not their province is doing a good job.
This would also make it possible to know clearly if the money has indeed been transferred by the federal government and to ensure that there is no duplication, in the sense that the central government makes ad hoc interventions in the area of health care and then creates obligations for the provinces at the same time as it has been reducing its contribution for several years.
In fact, one might wonder how the federal government can justify such blackmail when it provides only 13% of health care funding and the equivalent of 8 p. 100 of education funding.
All of these conditions demonstrate that the situation has evolved within the Canadian federation, but the way the federal government is acting has not. It continues to collect as much money as possible through taxes and employment insurance premiums.
As we saw again this morning, the Auditor General criticized the federal government's actions when it comes to employment insurance as bordering on illegal, by misappropriating contributions from employers and workers and by creating a program that is very harsh for the unemployed.
Last year, $4 billion of the $8 billion surplus was collected through this program. If the government were being fair in terms of its fiscal activities, and if it really needed another $4 billion to pay down the debt or for other expenses, it should have had the courage to collect it through taxes, or in some other way.
But taking the money from the employment insurance fund, where people make contributions to ensure coverage in the case of job loss, using this money for any other purpose is unacceptable. This situation was condemned by the Auditor General, by the program's chief actuary and more importantly, by those who fund 100% of the program, the employers and the workers who are unemployed and who, unfortunately, find themselves in a rough spot.
This situation needs to be rectified. The Bloc Quebecois has regularly brought this up, we have led an offensive with questions on employment insurance and the fiscal imbalance. We believe that we have made a positive contribution to the current system, until Quebec becomes a sovereign country.
We are making a very constructive contribution by stating clearly how these funds collected by the federal government should be used. This money should be limited to its jurisdiction, to allow the provinces to set things right as best as they can.
So, we have a debate on health care. We have moved beyond this stage, and we would hope that the government will take real measures, as soon as possible.
In February, there is to be a federal budget as well as a meeting with the premiers. We hope that this will produce something positive and constructive to ensure that the provinces have the money they need to fund their health care services adequately, for all those who use them and who deserve a system that is relevant, adequate and effective. This is the challenge we are faced with.",Bloc Québécois,Kamouraska--Rivière-Du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques,Paul Crête,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=14695e74-40d6-4b43-8e3d-12f902ec8806&Language=E&Section=ALL

It seems to me that in a confederation that is an appropriate way to go. First, we seek opinion across the country in the different jurisdictions. We seek opinion from those involved, for example, nurses, patient groups and people of this type. Then at that point, the federal government comes in, as it is doing, with the Romanow commission. It is my hope that the Romanow commission will make good use of what all of the provinces and these other groups have done.
I am surprised to hear him dismiss the tax points as a part of the federal government's contribution. That is the most decentralizing thing that we do. Having given up these tax points to the provincial jurisdiction we no longer have control over them and the provinces get the proceeds.
To proceed to say that the federal government is only putting in, and he has the figures for Quebec, nationwide 14%, when in fact we are paying 40% of the health care costs in Canada, is to underestimate the situation. Tax points count as do equalization payments, which benefit the province of Quebec, and so does the direct spending of the federal government on research and things of that type.
I know the member has a strong provincial view and that he passionately supports the people who live in Quebec. I believe however that the federal government should have a stronger not weaker say in health care.
Does he not at least think that when residents of the province of Quebec travel across Canada, or when they move to work in another province somewhere else in Canada, they should get exactly the same care that they get at home? The federal government is the only government that can guarantee that portability of the health care system, which the citizens of the province of Quebec have at the present time.",Liberal,Peterborough,Peter Adams,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cae8968d-ec08-4415-8747-d3967bf5fcc3&Language=E&Section=ALL

However, let us not forget that tax points are neither a form of federal assistance to the provinces, nor an expression of its spending power. Tax points are a historical fiscal rebalancing tool. The purpose of the transfers of tax points made to the provinces in the sixties was to give back to the provinces some of the taxation power they had given to the federal government in the early forties to fund the war effort.
So, it is a mistake to try to compare tax points as if they were a federal expenditure. They are not found in the Public Accounts of Canada. If they were a federal expenditure, tax points would be included in the section on the transfers to the provinces. That is not the case. This is not a comparison that should be made.
As to why we are upset by federal interference, the best example is the work done by the Clair commission and by the Romanow commission. The Clair commission examined the whole issue of health. If the federal government had understood that its responsibility is to see if it can help by making funds available and by dealing with the fiscal imbalance issue, it would have realized that this is its true role.
By creating a commission that duplicates all the work done by the provinces in this area, the federal government is doing something useless. Indeed, this is a task that could have been much better defined, with very specific objectives, instead of giving such a broad mandate, as if we lived in a unitary state. We do not live in a unitary state. We live in a country where there are provinces that have responsibilities, that have expertise, that have examined the issue and expressed their views, and that are now waiting for the federal government to act.
With respect to mobility, we have the federal government's model that is supposed to ensure mobility between provinces. We have the Council of Ministers of Education. Rules are set by the provincial ministers. This is not a matter of funding; it has to do with how the system operates. The federal government has always tied the funding of the system to standards. That is what the provinces are opposed to, because the reality varies greatly from one province to the next. They have specific needs and different ways of doing things.
Let us take an example slightly outside the area of health. Quebec has put in place a family policy, 5$ day care, so that workers can benefit from lost cost day care. Had we waited for a Canada-wide federal system, we would still be waiting, because this is the kind of need that is not felt the same way in every province. This is probably all for the better. Perhaps $5 day care would be relevant in Ontario, but less so in another province.
There is a need for appropriate solutions in each area. Never in the past did the federal government show any special skill in the area of health. We only need to look at how it operates the only hospitals under its jurisdiction. To look at the kind of health care it has provided to aboriginal people throughout Canada. To look at the cuts the veterans' hospital has been stuck with. It then becomes clear that, in spite of what was said in all the debates and because of our ongoing concern for our fellow citizens, the competence and expertise is in the provinces.
The federal government should face the fact and realize that its role is in distributing funding. It must recognize that there is currently a serious fiscal imbalance. This is especially true when the federal government rakes in $8 billion in surplus and the provinces collectively complain about its contribution being insufficient.

We both come from regions. I remind members opposite, including the hon. member for Peterborough, that what the federal government collects in taxes does not belong to it. It belongs to the people of Canada and Quebec.
When the Quebec National Assembly unanimously asks the federal government to reinvest in the health system and the federal government says no, I do not think that it is using the taxes paid by Canadians and Quebeckers properly.
As I was saying, I come from a region and I would like to ask my colleague a question. I am personally aware of the impact of the underfunding of health and social services in a region like mine.

A few years ago, when the federal government began to back out of funding, we drew up a sort of balance sheet of what the impact on our communities was. If the federal government does not give money to the provinces, the provinces cannot give money to the municipalities, unless they make budget choices that have a negative impact on other areas of activity.
We came to realize that, ultimately, this situation led to the closure of nursing homes, to hospital bed shortages, and to less home care. These are services our people want, services they want to see delivered. As well, society has to meet the special costs involved in providing services to people in the more isolated areas.
The entire territory needs to be serviced. Each region of Quebec has its regional health administrations and these try to perform miracles with the money available to them, in order to deliver proper services.
We have become aware, however, that the lower federal contribution in recent years has ended up drastically reducing the funds available to the provinces, and in the end everyone has had to try to accomplish miracles. The very direct consequences of this have been that our small rural communities are losing residents, as people move to larger centres where they have access to services. I think that this is not a good thing for our communities in the medium and long term. Something needs to be done.
I would like to make it clear that Quebec is convinced that there is a fiscal imbalance. The three parties in the Quebec National Assembly, that is the Parti Quebecois, which forms the government, the Liberal Party of Quebec, which forms the official opposition, and the Action démocratique du Québec, are unanimous on this.
There are also 29 stakeholders from civil society who have taken collective action. According to them, there is only one defendable position in Quebec, which is that we are short of funds. The federal government, a government with a surplus, is the one that has control of those funds, and it is absolutely imperative that it distribute them to the provinces, to do away with the fiscal imbalance, which has such a negative impact on our health system.",Bloc Québécois,Kamouraska--Rivière-Du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques,Paul Crête,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=14695e74-40d6-4b43-8e3d-12f902ec8806&Language=E&Section=ALL

I rise today to participate in the debate on the future of the health care system in Canada. I rise today as the member of Parliament for the riding of Haldimand--Norfolk--Brant in southwestern Ontario, a rural riding that may reflect different realities than other ridings throughout this country. We have a very large agricultural base. In fact I represent about 70% of the tobacco farmers in this country and their lifestyles reflect also a lot of the health realities in my riding. I represent a riding that has the largest first nations reserve in the country, the people of Six Nations. Again it is a different microcosm of lifestyles and health problems that face that community.
I speak knowing that a lot of the services we receive in rural Canada, and even in parts of southwestern Ontario that I would say are not remote, are not at the same level of service as is reflected in some of the urban centres across the country. The rural caucus of the Liberal Party made sure that Mr. Romanow in his deliberations was aware of some of the unique circumstances that we face in rural Canada.
Today I want to talk about the commitment of the government to health care. The Speech from the Throne made it very clear that the renewal of our health care system is a key priority for the government. The throne speech said that no issue touches Canadians more deeply than health care. Our health care system is a practical expression of the values that define our country. If I talked to Canadians, particularly people throughout my riding of Haldimand--Norfolk--Brant, and I asked them what their key concern was, I would say it would be health care and the future of health care in this country.
The commitment of the government is to ensure that there is a comprehensive system of health care that remains publicly administered and in particular, universally accessible. As most of my colleagues know, just last week the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology tabled its report “The Health of Canadians--the Federal Role”, the Kirby report. I encourage all Canadians to look at that report. The committee consulted with Canadians, as has Mr. Romanow. The committee has made specific recommendations that I think should be part of the debate on health care and the future of health care in this country.
In late November, which is just a few weeks away, the Romanow commission will table its report on the future of Canada's health care system. Members of Parliament are anxious, as are the rest of Canadians, to get to the task of setting health care right for the future. The recommendations in both the Romanow and Kirby reports will assist our government in our efforts to do this. The Prime Minister will then sit down with the premiers of the provinces once again, as he did a few years ago, and try to work with them in terms of setting up a future role for health care in Canada.
The Speech from the Throne refers to the 2000 first ministers meeting when an agreement was reached on health care that reinforced our collective commitment to the principles of medicare, to work collaboratively to reform our system and to measure the report of our progress.
Health care renewal is by no means the single area of focus of the Government of Canada. Another issue to which we committed in the Speech from the Throne was healthy living. I do not have to tell members of the House that increased levels of physical activity, healthy eating and other preventive measures would translate to a better quality of life for all Canadians, indeed probably a better quality of life for most members of Parliament, including myself.
The burden of chronic disease on Canadian society is enormous. Currently two-thirds of all deaths in Canada result from four groups of chronic diseases: cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases. In consideration of this the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health agreed in their September 2002 meeting to work together on short, medium and long term pan-Canadian healthy living strategies and to emphasize nutrition, physical activity and healthy weights.
One key to effective, affordable and responsive health care is for governments, the health care community and individual Canadians to concentrate on the promotion, maintenance, improvement and particularly the prevention of illness. While many health promotion and disease prevention efforts have been successfully underway in many jurisdictions for some time, a more concerted pan-Canadian and integrated approach to healthy living is necessary to make substantive changes in the health outcomes of Canadians.
The aims of the healthy living strategy are to promote good health, to reduce the risk factors associated with diabetes, cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and the burden and the costs that they put on our health care system.
The Government of Canada will be working with provincial and territorial colleagues to develop short, medium and long term pan-Canadian healthy living strategies that will address these issues. Together with the provinces and territories, we will hold a healthy living summit to bring together health and other sectors of government, non-government organizations, health specialists, first nations and Inuit, business and other stakeholders to the table. It is key, to get these changes, that we need to involve all Canadians because all Canadians have a stake in a healthy Canada.
A series of initial consultations with these stakeholders will precede the summit. The summit will provide an opportunity to set out specific strategies to support healthy living in various settings, one being healthy communities, including rural, remote and northern areas.
As I said, we in rural Canada need to feel we are involved in this process. I know Mr. Romanow was very attentive to the remarks that the rural caucus put forward to him. I think the premiers, the ministers and the public servants working in this area need to recognize more fully that rural Canada needs to have a larger say in these sorts of issues.
In June 2003 ministers of health will be presented with a proposed collaborative strategy for healthy living. It will include an overall vision for action; short, medium and long term objectives; key components, interventions and deliverables; and indicators for measuring progress in the short, medium and long term.
Over the long term the strategy will address a range of health care issues while initially focusing on building on health care promotion and disease prevention efforts which have been successfully underway in jurisdictions for some time.

I would like him to comment on what I think are some of the fundamentals for healthy living and for an injection of real health back into our health care system.
In order to give health back to our health care system and restore federal support for health care back to the 25% of the public health care spending in the short term, we need to move it back to the original fifty-fifty federal-provincial split at its inception. Does the member agree?
I am also interested in knowing whether the member is considering the issue of extending universal health coverage to Canadians in need of home care and in need of extended pharmacare. So many people in our ridings are talking about the fact that home care, pharmacare and care for seniors in their declining years is woefully underfunded.
Perhaps the member could talk about the need for more money and the need to actually add into the Canada Health Act some new pillars, which would be such areas as home care and pharmacare, and how that fits into the member's healthy living assumptions.",New Democratic Party,Dartmouth,Wendy Lill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=40e50704-8f9f-4468-93fd-1abf14fff088&Language=E&Section=ALL

I have been promoting that idea for a number of years.
As she said, it is a collaborative effort. It is an effort where the provinces, federal government and municipalities need to take an important role. With that collaborative effort comes certain responsibilities. It is not for me to say who would best do what. That would be done through negotiation and dialogue with the different levels of government so that each level of government can use its expertise. I support her idea that we must do more in that area.
In terms of restoring federal spending, that seems to be a debate put forward by the premiers in ads on TV saying they are only spending so much. There are different views on what is real spending from different levels of government.
The Prime Minister has said that our levels of spending are back up to what they were. It was in the neighbourhood of 40% to 44%. When the provinces decided that they wanted the system changed to tax points because it would benefit them, the federal government agreed. When the provinces received all the money, they have now come back and said they are not getting as much money.
We changed the system to benefit the provinces. It is not a question of who spends what. Canadians want to ensure they have affordable and accessible health care. All Canadians, no matter where they are from, no matter what their spending power, no matter what their income, should have accessible health care available to them.

I would say that the Kirby report was a classic case of medical malpractice. It had the wrong diagnosis, in my mind and in the minds of New Democrats, for what ails our health care system today.
Like other opponents of our health care system the Kirby report wrongly claimed that government could no longer afford medicare. It conveniently overlooked the fact that nationally we spent a smaller percentage of our GDP on health in 2001 than we spent in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Is less than 10¢ on every dollar of our collective wealth too much to spend on health care? Most Canadians would say no.
The Kirby report astoundingly, after much supposed consultation, flies in the face of what Canadians want in their health care system. The Kirby report begins with the premise that health care is a commodity to be bought and sold, and that medicare should be subjected to market based reforms. The majority of Canadians have made it clear that they do not agree with this recipe. Instead they view the medicare system as a public good that should be protected from the market.
The Kirby report advocated the further privatization of our public medicare. The report claimed that it did not matter who owned the health care institutions or services. Public studies have shown that private for profit health care is more expensive, inequitable and unaccountable than any public system.
The Kirby report ignored the threat international trade deals pose to our public medicare. The report approved private for profit ownership of care but ignored the far reaching and adverse implications of this under the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals.
The report did not recommend adding home care and pharmacare or long term care to the Canada Health Act. These are issues we have just been discussing across the floor. These are critical issues for an aging Canadian population.
The report recommended a limited approach to expanding medicare to include home care, but did not address the root causes of soaring drug costs and excessive patent drug protection. The report made no specific recommendations for increased public spending of long term care and ignored the need for national programs and standards in these three crucial policy areas. The Kirby report had no cures for our system and simply kicked out further the foundations of our proud, effective and efficient health care system.
The question is, what is it that has brought our system to the state that it now finds itself in? New Democrats and Canadians believe that the Liberal government's policy of underfunding health care has created the breeding ground that enables opponents of medicare such as Ralph Klein and Senator Kirby to exploit public concern. New Democrats will be fighting for full restoration of federal funding for health care, as well as a renewed plan that includes expanded universal health care beyond hospital walls to take in home care and prescription drugs.
Tommy Douglas first established medicare in Saskatchewan over 40 years ago. Twenty years later he saw his vision of a national health care system destroyed by the practice of double billing. In a speech in 1982 he rallied support for federal action by declaring that he for one would not sit idly by and see that happen. The Canada Health Act results from his efforts. Tommy Douglas did not sit idly by and neither will we.
Privatization, long waiting lists for surgery, crowded emergency rooms, woefully inadequate home care and long term care, shortages of family doctors, nurses and other professionals, that is the Prime Minister's legacy thus far for our health care system.
The Romanow report due in November is expected to provide a blueprint for a renewed federal role in health care. New Democrats believe that this renewed role must be a significant increase in federal funding to the provinces, an enforcement of the Canada Health Act to stop the proliferation of private clinics and hospitals, and the introduction of the long promised national pharmacare and home care programs. New Democrats will be fighting for these measures, and will oppose any “rob Peter to pay Paul” proposal for funding the federal increase in health care transfers.
We have seen trial balloons about increasing the GST or further cutting employment insurance to pay for increases in health care funding. Such moves would be unfair and unacceptable. If the Liberals need more revenue for health and social programs, they should look first at the ill-advised tax cuts contained in the former finance minister's 2000 budget. Those tax cuts benefited the banks, big business and the wealthy.
People often ask: How would the New Democrats fund the health care system, and where would they create the wealth that is required to put this system back in the shape that is required? I would like to put forward some concrete ways that we would suggest to put the needed resources into health care.
Next month, Mr. Romanow will complete his report on health care and recommendations for reform will cost money. We all know that. The government has refused to rule out a tax hike. We are against the idea of a tax hike or increasing the GST. We believe in a progressive, sustainable tax system and, moreover, we believe that health care funding should come out of general revenues.
I do not like the idea of dedicated taxes, like those being floated, which would corrupt the flexibility of the federal government. A dedicated tax is a last resort idea which should be adopted only when all else fails. The goal is to ensure that the burden of health care costs would be fairly and progressively shared by restoring the progressivity and the sustainability of our income tax system. Here are some suggestions as to how we could do that, how we could raise the revenue necessary to fund our health care system.
On the revenue side, we would start by closing some important tax loopholes, such as tax expenditures which target certain individuals and industries, and which are not in the public interests. We could close or narrow the scope of some of these tax expenditures to generate additional revenues for the federal government.
For example, there is the capital gains tax. In 2000 the former finance minister announced two consecutive reductions in the capital gains inclusion rate, the first from 75% to 66% and the second from 66% to 50%. The Liberals underestimated the cost of those tax expenditures, almost a million dollars for 2001 alone. If we were to restore the capital gains inclusion rate to 75%, then we would retrieve an average $1.2 billion a year in additional revenue to put back into our health care system.
A second suggestion that would help at this point to get more money into the system would be to restore the progressivity of our income tax system. Over time, the number of income tax brackets and the associated marginal tax rates have fluctuated wildly. In the 1960s the marginal tax rates for top income earners was as high as 60% for incomes over $400,000. However, in 1972 dramatic changes were made in the Income Tax Act, including a reduction to the top rate to 47%, and later to 43%. In 1987 there were 10 marginal tax rates, ranging from 6% on the first $1,320 of income to 34% on taxable income exceeding $63,000.
In conclusion, we believe that by adding another tax rate and by working on capital gains loopholes we would be able to begin to address the inadequacies in the funding in regard to the Canada Health Act.",New Democratic Party,Dartmouth,Wendy Lill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=40e50704-8f9f-4468-93fd-1abf14fff088&Language=E&Section=ALL

We need only look at the tax cuts announced recently by the Prime Minister.
I would like her to comment on the fact that in the United States George Bush announced trillions of dollars worth of tax cuts and then 9/11 happened. The country found itself in an emergency situation. Many of those tax cuts, I am sorry, were cancelled. He simply said “We are in an emergency situation. We cannot show this kind of largesse.

I agree completely that a national emergency is upon us now in the same way that we have faced national emergencies at other times.
At present our population is struggling under a critical health care shortage. There are ways in which we can address that shortage on a universal basis, which is the bedrock of this system. The most obvious way to do that is to look at our tax system as it now stands. There is a higher capital gains inclusion rate that we could be looking at. We could be looking at a new tax bracket for people who are at the high income rate. These are issues that have been adjusted downward to benefit the very wealthy in this country. What we have seen instead has been a colossal disregard for the health care of the people who are at the lower income spectrum in our country.

It has been an interesting afternoon. With the discussions that began a couple of evenings ago in the take note debate, a lot of ideas about health care have been put forward.
What is it going to take to restore timely quality care to Canadians? There has been a lot of discussion about the Kirby report that was just released. Is that going to provide solutions for us? Senator Kirby and his committee from the Senate are recommending a cash infusion of about $5 billion. In order to fund that, will there be an increase in income tax or in the GST or will it be both? On the government side there is a lot of breath-holding while waiting for Mr. Romanow's report, which is expected to come down next month. It seems likely that Mr. Romanow will be making similar proposals.
It sounds like a pattern we have heard before. Coming into the last election in 2000, there was the health ministers social contract, which was signed with an infusion of dollars to solve the health problems, and yet here we are two years later and more money has not solved the problem. The question that might be asked is, how much money will it take to solve the problem?
There has been a lot of talk about the rising cost of drugs and making sure that there is access to the drugs that people need, especially seniors on fixed incomes and Canadians who are required to take drugs.
I will review what has happened with health care costs in British Columbia. In 1990 when I moved to British Columbia with my wife, about 30% of all provincial government expenditures were on health care. By 2000, during the election, it was 40%. Now, just two years later, we are at 42%.
I know that B.C. health minister Colin Hansen is very concerned about those rising costs. In fact even though the government has put a $1.1 billion increase into the provincial budget for health care in British Columbia, there is still a widespread perception that it has actually cut health care funding because there are hospitals closing and services being withheld. The costs are rising so dramatically.
Perhaps we need to look at how many dollars are going to be sufficient and whether any amount of dollars would be sufficient if we keep going the way we are going.
Madam Speaker, I was remiss in not saying earlier that I will be splitting my time with the member from Surrey.
In our health care spending perhaps we need to look at how we are spending, and perhaps we are not going the right way. I practised for a lot of years as a health professional myself and sometimes I had to use an analogy with my patients. Because we lived on Vancouver Island I would say to patients that if they wanted to drive to Victoria and sincerely believed they were heading that way but noticed communities like Comox and Courtenay as they passed them, perhaps going faster or spending more money would not get them where they wanted to go. They were simply going in the wrong direction.
Perhaps that analogy applies in the health care debate to a certain extent. Perhaps we are missing the mark. Part of the discussion about health care that we need to have is being held to a certain extent, but I do not think it is near enough to the forefront, and that is the discussion about effectiveness and cost effectiveness. That is what I would like to talk a little about.
One of the situations to which I referred during the election involved a person whom I have known for years who ended up with chest pain. He arrived at a hospital on Vancouver Island. His pain was gone in a day but they kept him in hospital for ten days. He would rather have been at home. That was nine days that he did not need to be there. It was nearly $1,000 a day for a hospital bed that he did not need and someone else could have been using. What kind of efficiency is this? It was $9,000 worth of taxpayer dollars spent in the name of health care and it had nothing to do with health care. The only obscure connection is the fact that if they let him go home they knew it would take six weeks before he could get an angiogram in Victoria.
An angiogram was necessary to determine which type of cardiac surgery he would need, whether it would be angioplasty, cardiac surgery, stent surgery or bypass surgery. At that time in British Columbia there was a logjam of 600 people waiting for this procedure and wondering whether they would live or die waiting for an angiogram. Yet if the patient had had the money in his pocket, some $2,000 to $4,000, he might have gone down the street to a very well qualified and I think a very bright doctor in our community who is one of 1,500 doctors in North America who do an alternate form of therapy called chelation therapy. I thought we might talk about that for just a moment. What is chelation therapy? Maybe we should consider alternatives for Canadians.
According to Health Canada, cardiovascular diseases were the most expensive disease category in 1995, accounting for $7.3 billion or 17% of the total direct costs of illness. This is rather serious, as everyone knows, as does anyone who has experienced a heart attack or heart disease. I am sure there are many members in the House who have had surgery. My colleague right beside me can certainly testify to this.
I have here an article about chelation from The Globe and Mail of Tuesday, August 27. It states that patients of intravenous therapy swear that it gives them energy to burn. Now a new study will try to figure out if it works. I am sure this is anecdotal, but the article mentions one gentleman who lives in Burlington, Ontario, Mr. Lathe, who swears that chelation therapy has given him renewed zest. He walks with a spring in his stride, for up to seven and a half kilometres a day. He also testifies that he has had other improvements in his health. He is less forgetful. He said he has had an improvement in his “beep-beep”, something he said is a boon to a man of his age. He is over 80 years of age. In fact it was not a popular drug with a popular advertisement showing a man bouncing like a bunny and singing “good morning” that did it for him; it was an intravenous procedure that restored his function and he was pretty happy about it.
Early this month in the United States the National Institutes of Health announced a $30 million study led by the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to try to determine the effectiveness of chelation and/or high dose vitamin therapy for people with coronary artery disease. This is a five year trial with almost 2,400 subjects who will be receiving either chelation therapy or a placebo.
In Canada chelation therapy is largely unregulated, but I know from my own community that there are many people who have experienced chelation therapy and swear by it. I have seen people who were at risk of having amputations who have had their limbs spared because this intravenous chelation, which is designed to take heavy metals out of the body, in fact coincidentally seems to strip cholesterol out of the arteries and improves function that way.
There is a person in North Vancouver who has written a book called Addiction by Prescription: One Woman's Triumph and Fight for Change . We talk about the high cost of drugs, but perhaps drugs are not the only answer or in fact the best answer for all conditions. Joan Gadsby has written a book about benzodiazapines. Sadly, up to 30% of our seniors may be taking a drug, a tranquilizer or a sleeping pill that they do not really need.
Going beyond that, a Canadian company has come up with a very creative strategy for mental illness. It has found a very simple mineral supplement that reduces the need for psychiatric medications for patients who are bipolar. An article about it was published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in December 2001. Why is it that Health Canada now has put the brakes on this study that got many patients off their prescription drugs and taking a nutritional supplement that would lead to them becoming low needs patients? This is something we want to see investigated further.
A startling article and new studies coming out are linking SV40, a monkey virus, to being a contaminant in our oral polio vaccine. There are recent studies linking many forms of cancer to a virus that contaminated polio vaccines: mesothelioma, osteosarcomas, retinoblastomas and, I know, non-Hodgkins lymphoma. About 6,000 cases a year are being diagnosed, an increase startling in Canada, but cancer viruses, it appears, can lie dormant in the body for decades before they are activated when the immune system is depressed.
Another article on the same subject states that nine million Canadians were vaccinated between 1955 and 1961. Whether they were infected is a scary thought but if it did come from the polio vaccine, perhaps we ought to look into it.
There are other studies that have just come out. I refer to Maclean's magazine in which it talks about autism and the mercury derivatives that may be causing great problems.
Perhaps we need to rethink some of what we are doing. We need to come up with creative strategies and look at all the alternatives as to how we can reduce costs by effective interventions. Then we would have the money to direct to our concerns for seniors, to palliative and home care and compassionate care for all Canadians.",Canadian Alliance,Nanaimo--Alberni,James Lunney,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a52ac646-bd34-440f-b534-2474625065e9&Language=E&Section=ALL

Last week was the ninth anniversary of my being elected and the election of the government across the way. One would think after nine years that we would have solved some of the problems instead of just having another take note debate. We have been taking note of health care for nine years and it is time to do something about it.
Within a month the Romanow commission will table its report. From the comments that have been made publicly by Mr. Romanow, it would appear that his major recommendation is that the health care system is fine, that it just needs a few more dollars and we just need to tinker with it.
I would argue that more money is not necessarily the answer. Day in and day out the Minister of Health gets up and brags about how much money, the billions of dollars, the government has put back into health care. It is convenient the government does not mention that it took out billions of dollars a few years ago. Even at that, after putting in all these billions of dollars, there are still problems with our health care system.
I would argue that the problem is that most of the new money which has gone into health care has paid for the increases in salaries for those who are employed in the health care industry. Seventy per cent of all health care dollars go to salaries.
British Columbia had to raise the sales tax half a per cent just to cover the doctors' pay increase. Doctors strikes from B.C. to Newfoundland and Labrador, nurses strikes, hospital workers strikes, more money into the system but the same waiting lists and the same problems remain. Somehow more money does not seem to be answering the problem.
Last week the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology tabled its volume 6 report on health care. There was an extensive list of recommendations, but the one that received the most media attention was its recommendation that $5 billion more from the federal government go into health care spending.
The Senate committee proposed different ways of raising this money. One of the ways was to increase the GST by 1.5%. I assume that most members seem to have difficulty with this. I know the public does. Canadians do not feel this is the answer because most of them remember when the Liberal government said that it would get rid of the GST, but who knows.
If this were to be imposed, it would mean that in British Columbia for each $100 a person spent, they would be paying an additional $2 in taxes just for health care.
One of the other suggestions was that the federal government should institute health care premiums. Again, in British Columbia this is nothing new. We already pay health care premiums. We are only one of two provinces that do.
The Senate committee recommended that there be a sliding scale of premiums dependent upon income. If this plan were to be adopted, it would mean that the average two income family of three or more in British Columbia would be paying more than $2,000 a year in medical premiums.
Despite the notion that every Canadian is entitled to health care regardless of the ability to pay, this is not always the case.
A couple of years ago I raised the issue of a constituent of mine, Tim Jeffries, who severely broke is ankle. He went into surgery to have something done and he was asked if his health care premiums were paid up which they were not. It was not until his mother paid his back health care premiums that he was taken into surgery. He was actually removed from the surgery room until his mother paid his back premiums.
It was noted that in the fall of 2000 an estimated 200,000 British Columbians were not covered by health care. Five per cent of the population had no health care coverage because of their inability to pay the premiums.
If the government were to adopt the Senate recommendation, it would mean that B.C. families would pay twice as much. It would be interesting to know in our province alone how many people would not be covered and certainly across the country how many people would not be covered by health care premiums.
The Senate report also recommended that new programs be added, such as home care for post-operative and palliative care patients and that these programs be funded fifty-fifty by the province and by the federal government.
One can accept the fact that people and particularly the provinces would be very skeptical about that. In B.C. the provincial government already pays over $10 billion or 41% of its provincial budget on health care.
The province increased its health care budget by $1.1 billion last year alone. If the federal government were to implement this, it would mean an extra $5 billion, but for B.C. it would mean only $650 million. That would be a help, but it is certainly only a small portion of its budget. To get this small portion of its budget, B.C. would have to agree to spend it the way the federal government wanted it to be spent.
The provinces are very suspicious about any federal government commitment of fifty-fifty. In the 1960s a Liberal federal government made a commitment to the provinces that it would share the cost of health care fifty-fifty. Right now the Liberal government is only funding 14%. This is a far cry from fifty-fifty.
Federal fuel taxes were brought in and they were supposed to go into highways and other transportation projects. Yet only 3% of these taxes go back on transportation.

I was just saying that the federal government promised back in World War I that the income tax would only be a temporary war measure. We know what has happened to income tax, so there is a lot of skepticism if one were to get into a fifty-fifty project.
It is interesting that some members, the NDP in particular, and other Canadians are really concerned about private health care in Canada. I really shake my head because we have private health care in Canada already. In reality every doctor's office, most of the clinics and most of the labs are private facilities. These groups, and again I point to the NDP, shudder at the thought of private hospitals, claiming that private hospitals are more concerned about the bottom line than they are about patient care. I have news for them. Public hospitals are also concerned about that.
I know that in my own riding there is a hospital where the administrator admitted that the hospital preferred to have long term care beds for seniors and others than surgical beds, because they were cheaper for the hospital to maintain. It was cheaper for the hospital to have seniors in extended care situations than to treat surgical patients. Why? Because the hospital was able to meet the bottom line and balance its budget, or at least get close. Even public hospitals are concerned about cost cutting measures.
Another example in my riding is a Surrey hospital which in the 1980s and 1990s went through some major, extensive renovations. It opened new wings, then turned around and moved out of the old wings and into the new wings. In essence no new beds or new facilities were created for the patients. Even though the population has increased by 100,000, for all intents and purposes, there are no extra beds available.
We have to be concerned. I have asked my constituents a number of times about these issues. I would like to share with the House that two-thirds of 1,700 respondents indicated that they did not have a problem with private hospitals. I gave them lots of information. I even mentioned that in the United States there was a study indicating that there was a two per cent higher risk of dying in a private hospital, and they still felt they could support it. They also supported paying for services. They felt that it was important to get facilities and to be able to pay for them.
It is time to quit studying the problem and to start fixing it. Canadians want to have an affordable, top notch health care system where no one is denied necessary medical services and where people receive the services in a timely manner. Everyone has to do one's part for this to happen, including Canadians.
Last but not least, Canadians have to take responsibility for living healthier lifestyles. Last night we saw a series on obesity. Canadians must take responsibility for their own health and well-being and live better lifestyles so that there is less reliance on our medical system to make up for their own negligence.
Canadians are ready for significant changes in our health care system. They want to have access to it. They need to have access to it but they want to have some choice. They are prepared to pay more to have that choice. It is time for the government to show a little courage, look beyond the status quo and provide Canadians with an adequate health care system that meets the needs of all Canadians regardless of their income.",Canadian Alliance,South Surrey--White Rock--Langley,Val Meredith,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=5dcf65db-981b-4d6e-9644-dd4b556a94c3&Language=E&Section=ALL

It seems to me that with the recent release of the Kirby report and the upcoming release, finally, of the much awaited Romanow report on the status of health care and the recommendations that we expect to be contained therein, it appears as though both those reports will primarily deal with the dollars and cents; that we will go down this road yet again, as the member alluded to in her opening comments, of simply asking for more money.
It would seem to me that the cry we have been hearing from coast to coast to coast in Canada is that it is simply not enough, that much more needs to be done to fix our ailing health care system and to provide the level and degree of health care that every Canadian is looking for.
With that likely to be the case, that Kirby will be asking for somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion more per year to be thrown into the existing health care system and likely Romanow will be calling for something similar, does she believe that with the recent admission, today as a matter of fact, of the government of its continued overtaxation of Canadians and the abundance tax revenue that it has, that there is room within the existing budget to provide the necessary funds for health care and that we do not need to look outside of it for yet more taxation from the government that has already taxed Canadians more heavily than any government in history?",Canadian Alliance,Prince George--Peace River,Jay Hill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=5c079946-a5d3-4808-819f-f7b9e073f5a3&Language=E&Section=ALL

I know with Canadians, health care is their top priority. The government has to identify that as its top priority and allocate the funds, which are already there for health care, within the budget. Instead of subsidizing and giving grants to businesses, corporations and special interest groups, it could be diverting that money to the health care system.
I have a friend who is very involved in the administration of a not for profit hospital in the United States in Washington State. They get many Canadians down there using their own money and money from our health care insurance policies to subsidize the American public health system.

I take real exception to a socialist who feels that dumping more money in to support his labour colleagues is the answer. It is not. It is going to take a commitment from absolutely everybody to make this thing right. He has to understand that Canadians support a health care system. They support the national insurance program that we have. However that does not mean that we cannot have a mixture in delivery of the service. We have a national health care insurance program. Nobody is arguing that and nobody wants to change that.
What we are saying is that there has to be a better way of delivering health care services so people are not dying while on a waiting list to get the surgery and the treatment they need.

Paul DeVillers (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)",,Government Orders,Health Care System,,"Madam Speaker, as we know, physical inactivity is a serious public health problem. One-third of Canadian children are obese according to a Statistics Canada report released two weeks ago. Close to 60% of young people are inactive to the point of endangering their health.
As children enter adolescence their physical activities start dropping sharply. Young Canadians aged 2 to 11 are estimated to spend an average of 19 hours per week watching television. Clearly the range of recreational choices available to young people has changed. Their habits have changed but not for the better. Three-quarters of overweight teens will still be overweight when they reach adulthood. The adverse effects of inactivity are taking their toll on the health and well-being of Canadians.
We must indeed be concerned by the rising rates of obesity anew and the high rates of physical inactivity among Canadians. As we can see, physical inactivity is dangerously gaining ground. For public health the impact is disastrous, incurring $2.1 billion per year in direct health care costs. Clearly, reducing the sedentary lifestyle of Canadians is critical to the future health of Canadians and the future of our health care system.
I believe that participation in physical activity and sport contributes to the prevention of illness and the enhancement of quality of life of all Canadians. Therefore, physical activity and sport should be viewed as an important vehicle for health promotion and disease prevention. Like other forms of physical activity, sport contributes to the health and fitness of its participants. When we invest in initiatives to encourage Canadians to engage in physical activity and sport we are investing in the long term health and well-being of Canadians.
An increased investment in sport means a decrease in health care costs. The benefits of participation in sport are well documented. They include reaching and maintaining a healthy weight and improved cardiovascular and muscular fitness, contributing to an improved quality of life. Studies have shown that participating in sports and physical activity increases resistance to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, obesity and mental health disorders. It is also estimated that if all Canadians were active this would save $5 billion annually in direct and indirect costs.
I know my colleague, the Minister of Health, strongly shares my concerns. That is why we are working together to develop linkages between healthy living, physical activity and sport. We are concerned by the rising rates of obesity in youth and the high physical inactivity rates among Canadians. To be able to contribute fully to society and to enjoy the best of life, first one must have good health. We all agree that good health comes from participation and physical activity in sport.
The national strategy for healthy living, physical activity and sport, announced in the Speech from the Throne will be a crucial tool to build a healthier nation. Recognizing the important contributions of physical activity in sport to the health of Canadians, as the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport I will be pushing for a balanced health care model that includes both treatment and care and disease prevention and health promotion. I look forward to continue working with the Minister of Health in developing this strategy.
I was pleased that Senator Kirby and the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology share this vision. In fact the Kirby report makes several references to the need for a sharper government focus in the areas of illness, disease and injury prevention. The report states that the standing committee was told repeatedly by those it consulted that government should develop public policies and programs that address non-medical determinants of health.
The Kirby report urges the Government of Canada to promote health and wellness by encouraging Canadians “to take a more active role in improving their health through for example, exercise, healthy food and lifestyle choices”.
I agree and that is why I have been actively promoting the need for greater strategic investments in initiatives that support increased participation in sport and physical activity. In short, we need to continue to support and invest in initiatives that promote a culture of physical activity, and foster healthy habits among all Canadians from the earliest age. In many areas the Government of Canada has already taken this action.
In April, my colleague, the Minister of Health, unveiled new physical activity guides for children and youth. These guides demonstrate the commitment of the Government of Canada to promote the health of our children and youth. We must all encourage children and youth to live more healthy and active lives.
These first-ever national physical activity guidelines for children and youth recommend that inactive children and youth increase the amount of time they currently spend being physically active by at least 30 minutes per day and decrease the time they currently spend sitting still by at least 30 minutes per day.
The goal of the guides is to provide parents, educators, physicians and community leaders with the information they need to help increase physical activity levels in children and youth, and lay the groundwork for healthy growth and development.
The guidelines were developed in partnership with the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology and are strongly supported by the Canadian Paediatric Society and the College of Family Physicians of Canada.
In April I had the honour to introduce in the House of Commons the proposed act to promote physical activity and sport. The bill demonstrates, once more, the Government of Canada's commitment to encourage, promote and develop physical activity and sport in Canada.
By introducing the bill the Government of Canada seeks, among other things, to encourage greater cooperation among the various governments, physical activity groups, sport communities, and the private sector to increase participation in sport among all Canadians.
Developed in concert with Health Canada, the bill recognizes that physical activity and sports are an integral part of Canadians' lifestyle and culture.
It also recognizes that sport and physical activity provide considerable benefits in terms of health, social cohesion and economic activity.
We want more Canadians to engage in physical activity, practice sport and get moving. However, we recognize that some Canadians face significant barriers in participation in physical activity and sport. For this reason the Government of Canada has taken action to facilitate the participation in sport among girls and young women, aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, youth at risk, visible minorities and the economically disadvantaged.
In July of this year I had the privilege to announce $551,500 in funding for 14 projects under the sport participation development program. The program was developed on the basis that all Canadians should have access to and benefit from participating in quality sport activities at all levels. We are proud to support national sport organizations in their efforts to increase ongoing participation in sport, recruit new participants and reduce dropout rates.
I am confident that the projects supported by the sport participation development program will contribute to getting more Canadians involved in sport and that this will result in more active and healthy Canadians. Clearly from the federal initiatives that I have outlined the Government of Canada is working to create a culture of physical activity to foster healthy habits among all Canadians from the earliest age.
Right now, in Canada, only 48% of girls between the ages of 5 and 14 play a sport, compared to 61% of boys. The Government of Canada is concerned about the fact that a majority of Canadian girls and women are not reaping the benefits of physical activity. This is a problem we must address.
The Government of Canada is committed to increasing participation in sport at all levels and throughout the lives of girls and women. We will work together with the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity, and similar organizations in the provinces and territories to implement a sport participation strategy for girls and women.
We are not just developing strategies. We are taking action and supporting effective initiatives to get girls and women active.
Today I was pleased to participate in a walk with many of my hon. colleagues to promote On the Move Walking Clubs, a national initiative designated by CAAWS, the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity, to increase the participation of girls and women in sport and physical activity. Initiatives like On the Move highlight the importance of making time for exercise.
The Minister of Health and I applaud Chatelaine magazine and CAAWS for putting this program in place to encourage women to be active, which contributes to good health and ultimately a better quality of life.
On April 6, 2002, the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for sport, fitness and recreation endorsed the new Canadian Sport Policy. This is the first Canadian sport policy to have resulted from a cooperative effort by all 14 governments and extensive consultations with the sport community.
The Canadian Sport Policy is predicated on objectives of increased participation, excellence, resource allocation and interaction.
To translate these objectives into clear measures, all the governments signing on to the policy together defined their targets in a statement of priorities. This is a firm commitment. Each government has undertaken to implement measures over the next three years. Ministers responsible for sport recognize that we all must work together to increase the practice of sport by all Canadians. This objective of sport for all is an objective of public health and equal opportunity. In other words, participation in all types of sports, at every level.
To expand the practice of sport by all Canadians, governments have committed to identifying and eliminating the barriers to participation in sport, be it social, linguistic, cultural or economic. If we want more young people to practise sport and engage in physical activity, we recognize that we need to coordinate our efforts to facilitate access to sport facilities throughout Canada.
At the same time, each province and territory has undertaken to make sport and physical activity more important in school. The provinces and territories have committed to promoting these activities and exploring the various options.
The Government of Canada believes that sport and physical activity are an integral part of Canadian society and culture and, among other things, produce benefits in terms of health and quality of life. Reducing the sedentary lifestyles of Canadians is critical to the future health of Canadians and the future of our health care system. This is why as Secretary of State for Amateur Sport I will continue to promote participation in sport and physical activity as a way of life in Canada.
Good health and well-being begins with each one of us. We all need to fit physical activity into our lives. The Government of Canada believes sport is a priority for the public health as it is a fundamental element of the health and well-being of Canadians. We are committed to encouraging Canadians to improve their health by integrating physical activity into their daily lives and to assist in reducing barriers that prevent Canadians from being active.
We will continue to take action federally and to work with our partners to build a sporting and healthy nation.",Liberal,Simcoe North,Paul Devillers,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=009b4f74-7547-4e5f-84a6-8f499d699a94&Language=E&Section=ALL

I would like to give the secretary of state an option that would dramatically reduce obesity and it would not cost him a penny. Why does he not work with the provincial ministers of education and health to ensure that physical education becomes mandatory from K1 to grade 10? That was done in British Columbia. It would have a profound impact on the health of children and adults by getting them active, as the secretary of state correctly said.
The second question deals with the issue of children and a headstart program, not some large social engineering project but one that would focus on proper parenting, where parents would learn proper nutrition, discipline and care for children. Recent studies have shown that proper parenting is the most important factor in ensuring that children would be productive and integrated members of society, .

Paul DeVillers,,Government Orders,Health Care System,,"Madam Speaker, as a matter of fact the new Canadian sports policy that I referred to in my comments does have as one of its action plans, and it has been endorsed by all provinces and territories, to make physical activity and physical education more prominent in the schools.
The hon. member said we should make it compulsory from kindergarten to grade 10. That is an area of provincial jurisdiction. Certainly the federal government is there to encourage our partners in the provinces and territories who have jurisdiction over education. If they were to do that, it would be swell. However, that is their jurisdiction.
They have undertaken to make it more prominent in the schools. It is in the sports policy and action plan that they have endorsed. We will be meeting again as ministers responsible for sport in Bathurst prior to the Canada Games in February. One of the questions that I will be asking my provincial and territorial colleagues is what progress they have made on that action plan that we had agreed to in Iqaluit last year.
The hon. member makes reference to proper parenting and the headstart program. Those are areas that are important as well. From the Minister of Health's perspective or from mine as Secretary of State responsible for Amateur Sport, it goes beyond our jurisdiction to be setting up parenting programs. Those are in the area of social services which fall under provincial jurisdiction. I agree in principle that good nutritional habits would go a long way to assist young people in developing healthy lifestyles and would save us the health costs down the road.

It is a good idea. However, it would be wrong for the secretary of state to imply that by getting people to be more active would therefore solve problems with the health care system. It would not; it would defer the problems.
For example, over the last 30 years, there has been an increase in life expectancy of one year for about every five years that is passed. People live longer but that does not mean it costs the health care system less. Sometimes it costs more because people get more serious diseases when they actually do get ill in that age range of 65 to 75. We would defer the problem by getting people more active. We cannot use sports and activities as a way to avoid the costs. That is not true.
Some British Columbia statistics show that young people between the ages of 18 and 30 visit a doctor on average of once a year from sports injuries. It is a fact that when people become active, they sometimes injure themselves that way.
It is a good idea to keep people active because it makes them generally more healthy and they live longer, but it would not fix the health care problems. Does the secretary of state recognize that?",Canadian Alliance,North Vancouver,Ted White,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cef8c0c4-1880-45a2-9587-3855747576d2&Language=E&Section=ALL

Paul DeVillers,,Government Orders,Health Care System,,"Not for a moment, Madam Speaker, did I suggest that having people more physically active would cure all the health care problems. That was not my intent. However, it would have an impact because they would live healthier lives. The hon. member points out quite rightly that we are all going to die, but in the words of the old country song, “I wanna go to heaven, but I don't wanna die”.
If we were living more healthy lives, then, yes, there would come a time when we would no doubt reach the point where we might be on the health care system prior to our demise. That is a far cry from going through 20 or 30 years with Type II diabetes or some of the other diseases of which the likelihood of contracting is much higher through physical inactivity and certain lifestyles.
There are studies that have estimated a savings of up to $5 billion if all Canadians were as active as the small percentage of Canadians who are physically active. I disagree with the hon. member's premise.
With regard to sports injuries, there is a cost to everything. To become physically active, one must get out and run, and one might twist an ankle. However, the benefits are much greater when one gets out and becomes physically active and physically fit, than to sit back and say that one will not risk a twisted ankle.",Liberal,Simcoe North,Paul Devillers,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=009b4f74-7547-4e5f-84a6-8f499d699a94&Language=E&Section=ALL

I realize, Madam Speaker, that you are in the Chair and cannot say anything but I think both of us could inform the minister that women have always been on the move. Women are on the move even more now because we run from one job that gives us a salary to another job that does not pay, at home. We do that because we are taxed to death and women have to work to make ends meet for their families.

I want to start out my remarks tonight by laying out for the people back home who are watching this debate what I believe is going on here. The government is without an agenda. The government is in disarray and chaos because it is involved in a leadership campaign that really has not yet been called. We have a Prime Minister who says he will hang around for another 14 or 15 months.
The government prorogued Parliament and gave itself, and by extension ourselves as well, a break of an extra couple of weeks this summer after an already three month summer break from Parliament. This break supposedly was given to us because the government had an agenda. The government prorogued Parliament, killed the government and private member's bills, and that session was ended. The government came back to the House with a throne speech, and here we are. Let us take a look at what has happened this week.
A member asks if this is about health care. Health care is exactly what this is about.
On Monday we had a take note debate on health care. Usually take note debates, like emergency debates, are held after we do the regular business of the House and it extends into the evening. Tuesday was a Bloc supply day, so the opposition set the agenda. Today we are again debating the health care motion. Tomorrow is another opposition supply day. Where is the agenda of the government? The fact is it does not have a clue what it is doing.

I meant the opposition that is heckling over there. At any rate, I think I have made my point for the people who are watching that the government is devoid of ideas and that is why we are involved in this debate today.
I will be splitting my time, Madam Speaker, to give some time to my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, who has done an incredible amount of work over the years on the issue of health care. He has tirelessly recommended reforms and changes to our present health care system, much more than I have ever heard come from any of a succession of health care ministers of the government, since I came here in 1993, and much more than I have ever heard from anybody on that side of the House, other than to suggest the status quo.
If Liberal members wanted to be involved in the debate why were they not up a couple of hours ago when they had a slot that they gave to the socialists. They had an extra 10 minute slot but nobody wanted to talk over there so they gave it to the NDP. Now they want to talk when I am trying to talk. This is just incredible.
The Liberals want to be involved in the debate on health care. They are trying to suggest that the problem rests with the provinces and they are the reason we have these problems with health care. Yet the government, from 1994 to 2001, slashed cumulatively $25 billion from health care transfers to the provinces. Then it says the provinces have created the problem because they are the ones that administer health care.
I think the Canadian people are smarter than that. They know that the problem originated right over there when the Liberals made poor spending choices. They would rather subsidize businesses and some of their friends with pork-barrel politics and patronage. Those are the choices they made rather than put money into health care and our national defence, which is a whole other issue.
Obviously money alone is simply not enough. We on this side recognize that. For the Kirby report, and then pretty soon the Romanow report, to come out and suggest that $5 billion, or $6 billion or $9 billion or, whatever the magical number is, will somehow solve the health care problems that we face is simply a falsehood.
I want to take a couple of minutes to mention that I represent a huge rural riding. Prince George--Peace River is the eighth largest riding in the country, with over 200,000 square kilometres. We have a serious shortage of doctors, nurses and trained medical professionals up in northern British Columbia. From talking to a number of my colleagues, I know that is not unique to towns like Fort St. John, Dawson Creek, Fort Nelson, Mackenzie, Tumbler Ridge, Chetwynd, or even Prince George, for that matter, which is a major centre in central northern British Columbia, or Kamloops. It is a serious problem throughout British Columbia and all across the country.
Believe it or not, I recently read some good articles in the Ottawa Citizen . It is running stories this week in the city section about the growing shortage of health care professionals and doctors in Ontario and in the City of Ottawa. In yesterday's paper it said that 25 years ago there was a decision made that we had too many doctors so the provinces took action to stem the flow. Those measures were so successful that today 900,000 Ontarians have no family doctor.
This is serious. The status quo is not good enough. Over the last number of years we have heard Canadian Alliance MPs say over and over again that we seriously have to address this issue. We cannot just throw a few more billion dollars at it, circle the wagons and somehow pretend that will solve the problems of health care. People on waiting lists to see a doctor are dying.
I talked to some doctors the other day when they were here for their annual lobbying efforts to try to educate politicians about some of the problems they face on a daily basis. One doctor told me that it was not just a problem with doctors. Sometimes a doctor can examine a patient, arrange for an operating room, get it set up for the operation and then one person is missing.
Maybe it is the recovery room nurse who is not there and the whole operation is put on hold and people are told to go away because they cannot operate. The room is available. The doctors and the anesthesiologist are there. Everything is there except for one cog in the system, and the patient suffers and unfortunately sometimes dies. We have to get serious about this.
I want to give some time to my hon. colleague from Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca, a doctor who has actually practised in my riding of Prince George--Peace River, in the city of Prince George, for a number of years. As with many rural MPs from all parties, I fight all the time to try to help foreign doctors get into this country, and thank God we have them, but that too is not the answer.
The country is seriously short of medical professionals and money alone is not going to solve the problem. We have to start looking at a lot of different options, one of which I spoke about earlier, which is alternative medicine. We have to look at more ways to prevent illness rather than react to it.

His constituents ought to know of the very hard work he has done in trying to get physicians and other medical personnel in Prince George and at the place where I work.
Prince George is the major trauma centre for the northern half of British Columbia. I have been working there on and off since 1988. There have been periods, for example over Christmas, where for three or four days in a major trauma centre we did not have any orthopedic coverage for 200,000 people. In fact half of the specialist coverage was not there. We simply did not have it at that time. That is still a problem.
I want my friend to describe the situation he finds not only in Prince George but in his rural riding of northern B.C. because it affects rural ridings across the country. Perhaps he could comment on the lack of basic health care resources for his constituents and how to ensure that they have the proper care they desperately require. Perhaps he could comment on the pain and suffering they endure because of the lack of resources in the hospital and in his community at this point in time.",Canadian Alliance,Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca,Keith Martin,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c&Language=E&Section=ALL

They are considerable. I know other members do as well.
We try to alleviate some of the doctor shortages by assisting foreign doctors, primarily doctors from South Africa, to come to Canada. We help them to get through the myriad of problems with immigration and work visas so they can have a locum and can give Canadian doctors a break, in some cases the first break they have had for years, or give other professionals the opportunity to upgrade their skills, which they often do not have adequate time to do.
It is so serious that I cannot emphasize too much what we in Prince George—Peace River and, I believe, to a very large extent, in rural Canada, are up against. The rubber is meeting the road.
We are having this take note debate and I believe it is worthwhile. It allows members the opportunity to stand and present cases of how it is affecting their constituents and, in some cases, their very own families. I certainly have had experiences with my family. My father is on a waiting list for an operation back home and is in considerable pain. I know other members have similar experiences. It is tragic that we are still talking about health care instead of doing something about it.
One of the things we have to look at and that the government seems unwilling to look at is increasing the flexibility that the provinces have to be innovative. It is one of the primary planks of our platform on health care reform. I do not see it coming from the government. I do not see it, to a large extent, coming from Kirby and I doubt that we will see it from Romanow.",Canadian Alliance,Prince George--Peace River,Jay Hill,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=5c079946-a5d3-4808-819f-f7b9e073f5a3&Language=E&Section=ALL

The fact is that we have a situation where the numbers of people who are working are constricting. Right now four people work for every retiree. In the next 20 years two people will be working for every retiree. That, in and of itself, will put unsustainable demands on our health care system. No matter what we do in terms of rationalizing our resources, which we have to do, the bottom line is that we have to find money somewhere.
Raising taxes, we would argue, is not an option because it has a depressing effect on our economy and will restrict the amount of money coming back into our system for social programs like health care.
Where do we find the money? Our only other option is in the private sector. I would argue that allowing parallel private services would take the demand out of the public system without removing resources. If we do that we would have a sustainable public health care system in the future.
As my colleague beside me said, why do we not turn the table on the Americans? Why not have American patients come to our private system so they will pay money into our system which would then go to support our public system?",Canadian Alliance,Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca,Keith Martin,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c&Language=E&Section=ALL
