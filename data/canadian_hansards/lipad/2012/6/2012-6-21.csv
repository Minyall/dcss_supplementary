Under the Conservative government, often with the support of the other federalist parties, the number of disputes with the Quebec National Assembly have multiplied, as have the attempts to strip Quebec of its authority and its jurisdictions and weaken its regions, its economy and its institutions.
Can the government promise today that it will not spend the summer coming up with other measures that go against Quebeckers' interests and values?",Bloc Québécois,Richmond--Arthabaska,André Bellavance,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=8131817f-bf86-4739-9a70-6ef9de6f11b6&Language=E&Section=ALL

Let us go back to 2006, when there were problems. There was a fiscal imbalance that the Bloc passively supported for over a decade. The Conservatives resolved that problem in less than a year. We gave Quebec a seat at UNESCO. Then, there was a disagreement regarding the harmonization of the GST and QST. Once again, this was resolved under the leadership of this Prime Minister. There was also a disagreement regarding the Old Harry offshore oil reserve. Once again, who resolved this problem? It was this government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister.
So yes, I will assure my colleague of one thing: we will continue to practise open federalism for all Canadians and Quebeckers.",Conservative,Mégantic--L'Érable,Christian Paradis,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=cb9e0f12-f78f-4892-bc54-361d23267631&Language=E&Section=ALL

It has been obvious that over this session we have had our disagreements in both form and substance. It has been no surprise to Canadians that we, as the opposition, have fundamentally disagreed about some of the objectives of the government on pensions, EI and health care.
While we have had our disagreements, something that we absolutely agree on is that we have been supported by one of the most complementary and hard-working staffs of any legislature in the world. We owe them a great deal of thanks. This was a long and trying session for them as well.

On this side, we will not be taking time off. We will be continuing to work as we have so far.
Earlier today, I drew the media's attention to what the government accomplished this spring in terms of legislation. I will therefore not repeat what I said.
However, I am very pleased about what we have been able to do here over the past few months so that the House of Commons has achieved results by working hard and in an orderly fashion.
The co-operation from all corners of the House that we did receive to keep business moving here is much appreciated. Members of Parliament did a lot of hard work reviewing and debating bills, including quite important bills. At the end of the day, we voted on those bills and made decisions for the benefit of Canadians.
Bills remain on the order paper for our return in the fall, not to mention new ones to come. I will advise my colleagues at a time closer to our return as to the business of the House when we next sit.
While sitting MPs and the government's legislative program will return after the summer, we will have a new team of pages.
