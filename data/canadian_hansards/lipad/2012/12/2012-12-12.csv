Concerns include leasing of reserve land, on-reserve voting rights and scrapping the Navigable Waters Protection Act, which reduced protection of millions of our lakes and rivers to less than 200. No longer protected are northwestern Ontario rivers like the Kaministiquia, or the Nipigon River, home of the largest speckled trout in the world. 
Chiefs point out the Prime Minister promised that his government would never approve unilateral changes to the Indian Act. They are right. The government has not adequately consulted with first nations. However, neither has the Prime Minister consulted with scientists, academics, small businesses, Canadian workers, NGOs, provincial premiers, or Parliament, including his own backbenchers, so first nations chiefs are in good company.
 The PM does seem to consult frequently and widely with CEOs of banks, foreign oil companies and dictators of communist countries.

However, when interpreting the Constitution, the court adopts an inferior approach in which the intent of the framers is frequently ignored and the court instead consults with a different kind of extraneous evidence regarding present day Canadian values.
One reason offered for this departure from the sensible rules the court normally applies is that the documentary record regarding the Charter of Rights is simply too vast and too disorganized to permit ready consultation.
To assist with this problem, I am working with the Canadian Constitution Foundation to create, online, a sortable and word searchable database of all documents relating to the debate over the adoption of the Charter of Rights 30 years ago. This work in progress already contains over 100,000 pages of primary documentation. The website will go live on Constitution Day, 2013.

In recent months, for a variety of reasons, the atmosphere in the chamber has been at times difficult. This is perhaps not surprising since the House is made up of members who are committed and whose strongly held views are freely expressed on a daily basis.
The House is also an inherently adversarial forum that tends to foster conflict. As a result, sometimes emotions get the better of us and we quickly find ourselves in situations marked by disorderly conduct. Tone and gestures can cause as much of a reaction as the words used in debate. Lately, it appears that at different times the mood of the House has strayed quite far from the flexibility, accommodation and balance that ideally ought to exist in this place.
My task as Speaker is to ensure that the intensity of feeling expressed around some issues is contained within the bounds of civility without infringing on the freedom of speech that members enjoy. The Chair tries to ensure that our rules are adhered to in a way that encourages mutual respect. 
However, all members will recognize that ultimately the Speaker must depend on their collective self-discipline to maintain order and to foster decorum. My authority to enforce the rules depends on the co-operation of the House.
Our electors expect all members to make greater efforts to curb disorder and unruly behaviour. So I urge all members to reflect on how best to return the House to the convivial, co-operative atmosphere I know all of us would prefer. 
This would be a great help to me and my fellow Chair occupants, about whom I would also like to say a few words. 
I would like to take a moment to salute, on behalf of all of us, the excellent work of our Deputy Speaker, the member for Windsor—Tecumseh, and our assistant deputy speakers, the members for Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock and Simcoe North.
Often under trying circumstances, my colleagues in the Chair have soldiered on, doing their best to uphold the finest traditions of this chamber. As all honourable members are aware, unusual events arise frequently in the House. Thus the task of reading the will of the House is often left to Chair occupants—whether an unexpected sequence of events occurs or an expected sequence of events does not. 
Since the House resumed its sittings in mid-September, we have witnessed our fair share of instances where the House has been faced with unforeseen situations but has, nevertheless, found its way with the help of our chair officers. I want to say that the three gentlemen who share duties in the Chair have, in my view, upheld the highest standards of professionalism and impartiality while trying to facilitate the orderly conduct of the House business. 
Only those who have had the privilege of serving in the Chair and presiding over the deliberations in this chamber can truly understand to what degree the role involves as much art as science. I am very proud of the way in which the Chair occupants conduct themselves and I want, on your behalf, to thank them for their dedication to the institution and for their ongoing hard work.",Conservative,Regina--Qu'Appelle,Andrew Scheer,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=6519cfba-0080-419d-baa9-8ae6e56d032f&Language=E&Section=ALL

Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, on March 27, 1969, Jean Marchand, a minister in Pierre Elliott Trudeau's government, officially announced the expropriation of a parcel of land as big as the island of Laval to build an international airport.
Ottawa kicked out 3,000 families. We are talking about an area of 39,255 hectares to build the Mirabel airport on the most productive arable lands in Quebec. What became of this airport? It has been stripped of all commercial flights and passengers, who were ironically transferred to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport. Since then, the people of Ahuntsic have been forced to endure aircraft noise.
Another era, another city. Neuville is a community of men, women and children who have created an excellent quality of life for themselves over the years. They have also had rules to protect their land. Developers created a company for the purpose of building a private airport on land in Neuville. They had to comply only with federal regulations and were then able to get around the fact that the land they had chosen was protected agricultural land. They also disregarded municipal zoning and the regional county municipality's land use rules. 
Can a population be stripped of the right to control its own land? No. I am introducing this bill, which would amend the Aeronautics Act, so that the Governor in Council may make regulations respecting the location of airports only with the approval of a province.

House leaders for the official opposition and the government regarding the report stage proceedings on Bill C-45, a second act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 29, 2012 and other measures.
In making their interventions, both House leaders made two kinds of arguments. First, they made what the Chair would characterize as strictly technical procedural points related to the mechanics of report stage for Bill C-45. At the same time, they shared other views with the House on broader issues, such as the role of the Speaker in general and in relation to report stage, the role of the House and of the Speaker in a majority setting, and the role and rights of independent members in relation to report stage. 
In its earlier ruling on some of the purely procedural matters raised in these points of order, the Chair outlined the rationale for its selection for debate and grouping for voting purposes of motions at report stage of Bill C-45, in particular motions to delete. Motions to delete were a preoccupation for both House leaders: the opposition House leader wanted the Speaker to select them all and allow separate votes on all of them, while the government House leader did not want me to select any of them, to avoid votes altogether.
As I explained to the House on November 29, there are several precedents to justify not only the selection of motions to delete for debate at report stage but also to justify their grouping for voting purposes. These are long-standing practices of the House.
References made by the opposition House leader to rulings by Speakers Jerome and Fraser, while of interest, failed to take into account the evolution of our procedures as they relate to report stage, particularly a very clear direction included in the notes to Standing Order 76(5) and 76.1(5) since 2001. These notes outline the desire of the House to circumscribe report stage and instruct the Speaker to select motions for debate in accordance with certain criteria to ensure that report stage is not a mere repetition of the committee stage.
As I stated in my ruling on November 29, Debates, page 12611:
 In the absence of any specific guidance from the House with regard to motions to delete and other matters raised in the points of order, the Speaker cannot unilaterally modify the well-established current practice. 
Despite the brevity of the ruling, the Chair believes it puts to rest any ambiguity that may have been perceived with regard to the Chair's approach to the fundamental procedural aspects of selection and voting processes as they relate to motions at report stage.
With regard to the broader issues raised by the two House leaders, the Chair intends to address them thematically, beginning with the discussion on the role of the Speaker.
 House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Second Edition, at page 307, states that it is the duty of the Speaker:
 …to ensure that public business is transacted efficiently and that the interests of all parts of the House are advocated and protected against the use of arbitrary authority. It is in this spirit that the Speaker, as the chief servant of the House, applies the rules. The Speaker is the servant, neither of any part of the House nor of any majority in the House, but of the entire institution and serves the best interests of the House... 
O'Brien and Bosc further states that:
 Despite the considerable authority of the office, the Speaker may exercise only those powers conferred upon him or her by the House, within the limits established by the House itself. 
Speaker Milliken provided useful insight into this role when on April 27, 2010, on page 2039 of Debates, he stated:
 —the Chair is always mindful of the established precedents, usages, traditions and practices of the House and of the role of the Chair in their ongoing evolution. 
This not only confirms that it is not just written rules from which the Speaker’s authority is legitimately derived, as suggested by the opposition House leader, but that the evolutionary nature of procedure must be taken into account. It was on this basis of the House’s longstanding acceptance, and in fact expectations, of the practices at report stage, in conjunction with the need for adaptation to the current context, that the amendments for Bill C-45 were grouped for debate and voting purposes in the manner that they were.
Nor does the role of the Speaker in this regard vary from Parliament to Parliament, as has been suggested by the government House leader, who said:
 It may be justifiable in a minority Parliament for the Chair to accept any questions for the House to decide, because it is difficult to predict the intentions of the majority of members. This is not the case in a majority Parliament in general. 
Let me be clear, the Speaker does not make decisions based on who is in control of the House. Report stage motions are not and never have been selected for debate and grouped for voting on the basis of who the Chair thinks might win the vote on them. This is why, in the case of Bill C-45, the Chair rejected the proposal made by the government House leader that the Chair group certain motions, to use his words, “in a manner that recognizes the anticipated will of the House”.
The Chair is and will continue to be guided by procedural imperatives in all of its decisions, not by somehow substituting the Speaker’s prediction of the likely outcome of a vote for the expressed will of the House itself.
This brings me to a discussion of the role of the House as a whole. 
The role of the House in the legislative process must be seen in the larger context of the accountability of the executive branch and the elected members of the legislative branch. Speaker Milliken, in a ruling given on April 27, 2010, which can be found at page 2039 of Debates, stated: 
 In a system of responsible government, the fundamental right of the House of Commons to hold the government to account for its actions is an indisputable privilege and in fact an obligation. 
He continued:
 …it is why that right is manifested in numerous procedures of the House, from the daily question period to the detailed examination by committees of estimates, to reviews of the accounts of Canada, to debate, amendments, and votes on legislation. 
The House of Commons Procedure and Practice, second edition, at page 250, puts into context how our practices have attempted to strike an appropriate balance between government and opposition. It states that:
 —it remains true that parliamentary procedure is intended to ensure that there is a balance between the government's need to get its business through the House, and the opposition's responsibility to debate that business without completely immobilizing the proceedings of the House. In short, debate in the House is necessary, but it should lead to a decision in a reasonable time. 
The underlying principles these citations express are the cornerstones of our parliamentary system. They enshrine the ancient democratic tradition of allowing the minority to voice its views and opinions in the public square, and in counterpoint allowing the majority to put its legislative program before Parliament and have it voted upon.
In advocating a much stricter approach to the report stage on Bill C-45, the government House leader seemed to argue that the existence of a government majority meant that the outcome of proceedings on the bill was known in advance, that somehow this justified taking a new approach to decision making by the House and that anything short of that would constitute a waste of the House's time.
This line of reasoning, taken to its logical end, might lead to conclusions that trespass on important foundational principles of our institutions, regardless of its composition. Speaker Milliken recognized this when, on March 29, 2007, at page 8136 of Debates, he stated:
 …neither the political realities of the moment nor the sheer force of the numbers should force us to set aside the values inherent in the parliamentary conventions and procedures by which we govern our deliberations. 
Speaker Fraser on October 10, 1989, at page 4461 of the Debates of the House of Commons, also reminded the House that decisions on legislation are for the House alone to make, stating that:
 …we are a parliamentary democracy, not a so-called executive democracy, nor a so-called administrative democracy. 
I would now like to turn my attention to the issue of the role and rights of independent members in the context of report stage.
While acknowledging that some accommodation for the participation of independent members was necessary, the government House leader was critical of the current state of affairs, which he claims can allow a single independent member, as the government House leader put it, “to hold the House hostage in a voting marathon”.
As all members know, this year the House has had to deal with thousands of report stage motions when considering the two budget implementation bills, which resulted, in the case of Bill C-38, in around-the-clock voting. While this is not unprecedented, it is the first time it has happened since the rules governing report stage were changed in 2001. As is often the case in the midst of such consuming procedural challenges, frustration surfaces, our practices are examined and remedies are proposed.
As I have indicated, the note to Standing Orders 76(5) and 76.1(5) already provides guidance to the Chair with regard to the selection of amendments at report stage, and in particular, states the following:
 For greater certainty, the purpose of this Standing Order is, primarily, to provide Members who were not members of the committee, with an opportunity to have the House consider specific amendments they wish to propose. 
 It is no secret that independent members do not sit on committees in the current Parliament. In light of recent report stage challenges and the frustrations that have resurfaced, the Chair would like to point out the opportunities and mechanisms that are at the House's disposal to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of all members.
Standing Orders currently in place offer committees wide latitude to deal with bills in an inclusive and thorough manner that would balance the rights of all members. In fact, it is neither inconceivable nor unprecedented for committees to allow members, regardless of party status, permanently or temporarily, to be part of their proceedings, thereby opening the possibility for the restoration of report stage to its original purpose.
For inspiration on the possibilities, members need only to remember that there are several precedents where independent members remain members of standing committees. Short of that, there is no doubt that any number of procedural arrangements could be developed that would ensure that the amendments that independent members wish to propose to legislation could be put in committee.
Thus, it is difficult for the Chair to accept the argument that current report stage practices and rules are somehow being used in an untoward manner by independent members when simple and straightforward solutions are not being explored. Were there a satisfactory mechanism that would afford independent members an opportunity to move motions to move bills in committee, the Chair has no doubt that a report stage selection process would adapt to the new reality.
In the meantime, as all honourable members know, and as is stated at page 307 of the House of Commons Procedure and Practice, second edition: 
 It is the duty of the Speaker to act as the guardian of the rights and privileges of Members and of the House as an institution. 
Accordingly, unless and until new satisfactory ways of considering the motions of all members to amend bills in committee are found, the Chair intends to continue to protect the rights of independent members to propose amendments at report stage.
Finally, as we prepare to adjourn for the Christmas holidays, the Chair invites all members to reflect on how best to strengthen public confidence in this institution and on how best to balance the competing interests with which we always grapple.

 Motion No. 1 
 That Bill C-42 be amended by deleting Clause 1. 
 Motion No. 2 
 That Bill C-42 be amended by deleting Clause 22. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to bill C-42 at report stage and to speak to the two amendments that we have just moved.
First, I will begin by paying tribute to the women and men of the RCMP who work everyday to help keep our communities safe. I acknowledge the essential service they provide, often in the face of great danger and ignoring many of the individual challenges which surround their work in order to do their duties.
 In particular, I acknowledge the loss of two constables this year, Constables David Brolin and Derek Pineo, who lost their lives in accidents while on the job serving all Canadians. I also take this opportunity, while I am on my feet, to wish all the public safety officials, detective services and emergency services, who will be working when many of us are celebrating, a very happy but also a very safe holiday season.
Bill C-42 is before the House this session and we on this side supported it at second reading because we all must acknowledge that despite its proud history and its ongoing exemplary service, the RCMP faces some very serious challenges. What we are all hearing in our constituencies, and have all heard in testimony before the public safety committee, is that there are at least three major challenges.
 Among these challenges facing the RCMP is, first, the loss of public confidence. For many years, the RCMP has been an icon in our society and the trust levels still remain very high, as they should. However, anytime our national police force begins to lose public confidence, we must all be concerned and we must address the causes of that loss of confidence. The causes centre around a number of unfortunate and high-profile incidents involving the RCMP, which have resulted in deaths or serious injuries to the public.
 Some of this loss of confidence is to be expected whenever there are these serious incidents and, because the RCMP is charged with the use of force, many times these will inevitably be challenging situations. Some of that loss of confidence is a direct result of public concern about the structures to which we hold the RCMP accountable. In particular, members of the public are concerned about the police investigating themselves in these serious incidents. That loss of confidence in the accountability measures is not only a loss of confidence by the public, it is also a loss of confidence by serving RCMP members who have every bit if not more of an interest in independent investigations which will establish either their responsibility or non-responsibility in these incidents.
We also have serious evidence before us of a second challenge. That is a flaw in the culture of the RCMP. That flaw is that the RCMP has become a workplace with a culture that all too often has tolerated harassment in the workplace and specifically sexual harassment. When we have more than 200 women, who have served or who are serving in the RCMP, who sought to join a class action lawsuit alleging that they had faced sexual harassment on the job, then this is an important issue for the House of Commons to address. The magnitude of the problem cannot be denied.
Finally, it has become clear that there is a problem in the management of human resources and labour relations in the RCMP. This is a flaw that many have acknowledged is responsible for failures to deal with these other challenges in an effective manner. It cannot be denied that procedures are long, complicated, time consuming and fail to bring about changes needed to address problems both with individual behaviour and with more systemic problems. Therefore, again, it is a challenge which we must address in the bill before us.
The Conservatives presented Bill C-42 to the House just before the summer recess and suggested that it was the solution for addressing these challenges. On this side of the House, we responded that we felt the bill did attempt to address the challenges faced by the RCMP, but that it left lots of room for improvement at committee. Therefore, we supported Bill C-42 at the second reading stage in the hope that we could comprehensively address these major challenges. Now that the bill has been returned to the committee, after the Conservatives opposed and rejected every amendment to strengthen the bill, we have little choice but to oppose its moving forward at this time.
 We have proposed two amendments at report stage that will allow us to discuss some of the amendments already rejected at the committee stage. The first of those deletes the short title which we believe, as is becoming a tradition here in the House, is one of those overly political titles applied to bills. In this case, it is overly political in our view because it is called the “enhancing the RCMP accountability act” when in fact Bill C-42, in its unamended form, would fail to address that accountability challenge. Therefore, we do not believe the bill would accomplish this goal. I will say a bit more on that in just moment, but that is why we have proposed deleting the title, which would lead the public to believe that this challenge had been met.
Second, we have proposed deleting clause 22 so the RCMP act would retain its original wording in what is section 33 of the actual act. What it does is state clearly that the power to deal with grievances remains exclusively with the commissioner. In fact, what has happened in Bill C-42 is that the government has chosen to enhance the powers of the commissioner at the expense of everyone else working in the RCMP, even in respect to the new review body that is being created. Therefore, further concentration of power in the hands of the commissioner and the Minister of Public Safety is the answer proposed in Bill C-42 when almost every independent witness we heard before the committee said that the problem was exactly the concentration of power in the hands of the commissioner and the minister. 
When we asked what consultation had been done on the bill, the answer we received led me to believe that the minister, the RCMP commissioner and a senior RCMP leadership simply put their heads together and came up with a solution that gave them responsibility for resolving the problems. We could not find any of the witnesses who appeared before us who had been consulted about the changes included in the bill. We believe those witnesses provided some very good solutions and good ideas about how to address these challenges. 
The approach adopted in the bill, as unamended, relies very much on the model of the Royal Irish Constabulary. It is a 19th century model, dating from 1822, which was designed as a paramilitary model to help police and the Irish population that saw the British as an occupying force. Is this really the model we need for a modern RCMP? It ignores the lesson of the other British model of municipal policing, which was also established in the 19th century for the metropolitan police of London, based at Scotland Yard. 
The municipalities throughout our country have taken that model and developed it very effectively into a local community policing model, which has an independent board that keeps policing at arm's-length from a political minister and has very good accountability measures built into that model. Bill C-42, as unamended, sticks with the old paramilitary model instead of learning the many lessons we have learned at the municipal level in Canada about how to improve accountability and responsiveness to communities and how to create a more healthy workplace.
Witnesses at the public safety committee spoke out against these additional powers for the RCMP commissioner and the lack of independent oversight. Mr. Tom Stamatakis, president of the Canadian Police Association, said:
 --extraordinary powers in this regard...go beyond what one might find in other police services across Canada. 
 For example, in Ontario, a police officer who is subject to a disciplinary process retains the right to appeal the decision to the independent Ontario Civilian Police Commission. 
 As well, we heard from Mr. Robert Creasser, from the Mounted Police Professional Association, who had similar kinds of remarks. 
It became obvious to us in the NDP, after hearing the witnesses and experts, that the bill retained its deep flaws and would not meet those challenges referred to. It even fails to look at previous advice offered by Justice O'Connor in the Maher Arar inquiry. It fails to take into account the recommendations from the task force on governance and cultural change in the RCMP from 2007. It fails to take into account the recommendations from the former chairs of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission.
It is clear the bill could have been fixed, that solutions were out there. In order to play a constructive role, the NDP put forward amendments in four areas.
 The first of those was in the area of harassment. We proposed a simple amendment to add harassment to the training responsibilities of the commissioner. That was rejected by the Conservatives. Therefore, Bill C-42, which purportedly addresses the problem of sexual harassment, does not even have the word “harassment” in the bill.
Second, we proposed measures to strengthen the independence of the new proposed civilian review and complaints commission. The commission would report to the minister and would make only non-binding recommendations. We need a truly independent commission that can make binding recommendations.
Our third recommendation was to create a national civilian investigative body to ensure that the RCMP would no longer placed in a conflict of interest of investigating itself. The bill addresses this partially by allowing provinces, which have independent commissions, to investigate the RCMP. However, only four provinces have those measures in place. 
Finally, we introduced amendments that would have created balanced labour relations within the RCMP, including creating power for the independent review committee to deal with grievances. The concentration of power in the hands of the commissioner is part of the problem, not part of the solution.
Given the long time between major revisions of legislation like the RCMP Act, 25 years in this case, there is a great responsibility on us to get it right this time. As Bill C-42 stands unamended, we will be opposing its moving forward in the House.",New Democratic Party,Esquimalt--Juan de Fuca,Randall Garrison,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=f4efade5-e605-4926-b4d9-cea84ef76f14&Language=E&Section=ALL

I am disappointed to hear my hon. colleague's comments. He identified some of the main challenges that we as a government identified in working together with our colleagues who have been active police officers. We have 13 of them in our caucus. We have worked together with the commissioner and stakeholders to best address some of the challenges within the RCMP.
The bill is not perfect because, to really address this, we need to see a cultural change within the RCMP. Nonetheless, what we are proposing are fundamental changes supported by others. We heard testimony supporting our changes in the public complaints area and support for our addressing serious incident investigations. Here I would point out that no witnesses came forward to support the NDP proposal to create one body to investigate police. Hence, I am surprised that my colleague would even mention it. I am wondering why he is even bringing it up at this time.

The idea of a national civilian investigation body was first put forward by our hon. House leader in a private member's bill and received lots of positive comments and support. The reason it was not addressed directly in committee was that it was ruled out of the scope of the bill because the government did not seem to think it was necessary.

Vic Toews (Minister of Public Safety, CPC)",,Government Orders,Enhancing Royal Canadian Mounted Police Accountability Act,Motions in amendment,"Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-42, the enhancing Royal Canadian Mounted Police Accountability bill. I will be speaking to the amendments adopted by the committee and reported back to the House of Commons and how they will strengthen the legislation.
 Many of our members have already spoken extensively about the other issues raised in my colleague's speech. Needless to say, I do not agree with him. There was quite a bit of liberty taken with the facts in his presentation. I do not intend to rehash those. I think we can go back to Hansard to see what the true statements are in respect to the legislation, and how the legislation actually responds to the concerns of individual provinces. The types of amendments the member is suggesting are in fact exactly the kind the provinces rejected as too centralizing and outside the accountability they want to see brought back into the RCMP at the local level.
Here, I would reflect on why this bill is so important. It is no secret that the RCMP has endured its share of troubles over the last few years, including charges of harassment. To its credit, the RCMP has recognized the need to transform the institution by enhancing governance and modernizing its operations, including its organizational culture.
The next phase of the transformation process must come through legislation. It has been nearly a quarter of a century since Parliament amended the RCMP Act in any significant manner. In the interim much has changed, not just in terms of the globalization of crime but also in public expectations of greater transparency.
All in all, this bill would go a long way toward improving the accountability of the RCMP to Canadians and its own members.
The committee has approved several housekeeping changes, but there were also three substantive additions that I would like to recap briefly. These concerns were raised by witnesses before our committee, and I am proud that the committee worked together to further strengthen Bill C-42 based on the feedback we received.
The first concerns the rules in clause 11 around hiring retired RCMP officers as reservists. As members may recall, the reserve program provides the commanding officer with important staffing options. Reservists, for example, can help fill temporary vacancies, transfer corporate memory and mentor new recruits. Apart from all of that, senior officials have noted that reservists also reduce overtime work by regular members. In addition to making the workplace more efficient, the use of reservists can also improve safety and health. The amendment adopted by the committee permits the hiring of retired RCMP officers as reservists for six months or more without compromising their pension entitlements.
The second major amendment adopted by the committee addresses the issue of immunity for the commission chairperson under clause 35, and was specifically raised by the chairperson during testimony.
As members may recall, the proposed legislation would provide immunity to all those performing the duties, powers and functions of the commission. That policy was meant to include all members, including the chairperson. However, as the committee rightly pointed out, the bill did not explicitly note that the chairperson would also have immunity. The amendment adopted by the committee amounts to a few words, but they are important. 
The final change concerns the powers of the RCMP commissioner around complaints initiated by the chairperson of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission, also in clause 35. This was raised during testimony as a potential improvement. The committee adopted an amendment to clarify that the RCMP commissioner cannot refuse to investigate such complaints, thereby further enhancing the independence of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission, CRCC.
Taken together, these three substantive amendments have strengthened an already robust new framework to enhance accountability for the RCMP. The committee did enjoy the support of the New Democrats during second reading and for certain amendments during the committee stage, and that is why I was surprised to hear one of the NDP members mentioning that the NDP would not support this important bill.
I am even more disappointed to see two report stage amendments brought forward by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. I will speak briefly to the two report stage motions.
The first motion would delete the short title of the bill. Our government believes that the short title clearly captures the intent of the legislation and, therefore, we do not support the removal of clause 1, as we view this motion to be more about politics than about substance.
The member also moved that we delete clause 22, which addresses the RCMP Commissioner's authority to make final and binding decisions regarding serious grievances and appeals. Also under this clause, the commissioner is authorized to delegate this power in the event that he or she is not able to make the decision directly. This is consistent with existing authorities under the current RCMP Act. It also makes it clear to RCMP members that the grievance process is the primary source for resolution of labour issues within the RCMP. That is why these clauses are worded in that particular way.
It is important to note that judicial review continues to remain an option for members who are not satisfied with the outcome of their case. There needs to be some finality to a decision and that is what the legislation would do. If there are any concerns about the decision that the commissioner has made, that can always go to a judicial review. That type of judicial review process is familiar to anyone who has done administrative law. This is not anything unusual. In fact, it is a very clear, well-established way of ensuring that the body charged with making the decisions has the final authority, and the judicial review process ensures that the decision-maker stays within the bounds of his or her authority. As such, we do not support its removal from the bill.
It has been almost 25 years since the RCMP Act was substantially revised and it is now time to act. The government has consulted extensively with Canadians to develop legislation that meets the expectations of all Canadians for greater accountability of the RCMP. With the amendments adopted by the committee, I do believe we have achieved our goal. We now have before us an opportunity to inject new flexibility and efficiency into rigid management systems, to rebuild a culture of trust and to reinforce the faith of Canadians in the RCMP.
This party will be voting in favour of this legislation. I call upon the NDP to join with us in supporting the legislation.",Conservative,Provencher,Vic Toews,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=ab143dd3-e5b4-43fc-bc61-1279f1c395e9&Language=E&Section=ALL

I am not aware of any plans to deal with a particular building in the province of Manitoba. The Government of Manitoba, for years, has been a very strong partner in ensuring there is appropriate policing in the province of Manitoba. Many Canadians may not realize, of course, that the RCMP is not only a national police force but functions as a provincial police force in provinces like Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. As well, it performs the municipal policing function. Therefore, there are actually three levels of policing in the RCMP.

They just do.
What I am particularly concerned about is whether the legislation in fact addresses the central concerns that were raised in respect of the issue of harassment and sexual harassment. If one goes through the legislation, not even very carefully but at least reads it, it is clear that the issue of sexual harassment and harassment is addressed in the context of the legislation and also the broader framework of the commissioner's authority and those who are responsible for making decisions regarding the conduct of RCMP officers.",Conservative,Provencher,Vic Toews,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=ab143dd3-e5b4-43fc-bc61-1279f1c395e9&Language=E&Section=ALL

I will say at the outset that the Liberals will be supporting Bill C-42 at report stage and at third reading.
 Fundamentally, it is because, even though the bill is not by any means perfect, we find there are no compelling reasons not to support the bill and not to take the step forward in trying to solve a problem that has appeared to have become a little bit intractable over the years and which is undermining the credibility of one of our finest national symbols, which is, of course, our great national police force, the RCMP, which is composed of thousands of Canadians, some police officers and some civilians with a strong ethic of public service whose reputation, unfortunately, is being tarnished by the actions of a few who are not following the codes of conduct and not behaving properly as members of the RCMP. On top of that, their misconduct appears to take far too long to be addressed. 
That is what the bill is about. It is about changing the culture of the RCMP. I believe it was Mr. Brown who said that the current set of procedures, the current way of managing problems within the RCMP is just not up to the task of what has become a major organization.
One of the things that happens when organizations get very big as things progress and so forth is that they tend to become very bureaucratized. That is very much what has happened within the RCMP around how to deal with misconduct. Over the years, procedures have been created such that a case of misconduct goes through a hearing, then maybe another hearing and the problem never seems to be resolved, certainly not on a timely basis, and this leads to frustration.
I will now comment on what I observed at committee, especially during the amendment process. I observed that the NDP brought a particular model to the problem. It is not a criticism of the model but it struck me as being very much a labour-focused model, which is based on the notion that management's latitude must always be restricted in the interests of labour within the organization.
 There is nothing wrong with standing up for the rights of labour, especially in large organizations where we need unions, we need associations as a kind of counterpoint to the power of a large organization. However, when it comes to managing large organizations, we need effective leadership. We cannot have effective leadership if those leading the organization, in this case the commissioner, has his or her hands tied.
Leadership is not a bureaucratic process. It is an art form and it requires making judgments. If every time the leader of an organization wants to make a decision or make a judgment call, he or she is constrained by having to, for example, adhere 100% to the recommendations of a particular committee within the organization or an advisory board, then I cannot see that leadership in that organization would be effective.
That does not mean that leaders must not seek input from advisory bodies and so on, but to suggest that they must adhere to 100% of the recommendations is a constraint on leadership.
I noticed that, when we received witnesses, the witnesses who were representing RCMP officers, sort of within a union context, they saw the problem of harassment and the root sources of harassment within the RCMP very differently from the way, for example, Commission Paulson sees it. They said that the reason for harassment was because the line officers in the management structure had too much power and that there was a kind of cronyism that had set in. By definition, if we accept that assumption, then we need to restrict the powers of management that much more.
This point of view is diametrically opposed to the basic principle at the heart of this legislation, which is to give the commissioner and managers down the line more latitude, more power, to resolve disputes quickly and to take effective action if someone is found guilty of misconduct and not behaving properly according to the ethics and conduct code of the RCMP. 
I think that there is a fundamentally different way of looking at this problem. However, I must say that we come down on the side of giving more authority to the commissioner to deal with these problems. If he or she does not deal with these problems, we can be very certain that the media will bring them to the attention of the minister, the government and the opposition. Outside pressure will be brought to bear on the management of the RCMP. Therefore, it is not as if the RCMP has no accountability to the broader society in which it operates.
It was brought up many times that a sexual harassment code was not included in the legislation. However, members have to understand that when we are dealing with enabling legislation, we do not include that level of detail. I have never seen it where we would include policies and codes in enabling legislation.
 I take the point that we are trying to address the problem of sexual harassment in the RCMP as well as other problems of misbehaviour. However, the bill does provide the minister with the authority to create a harassment policy. Of course, that harassment policy will be the subject of great interest on the part of the opposition and the media, which will make sure that it is a proper policy and that it is strict enough. Again, there will be some accountability in that respect.
According to some, the bill may have fallen short with the new commission, which will look into public complaints against the RCMP, in that it could have had its power enhanced. The scope of its power could have been broader. There is no doubt about that. For example, Justice O'Connor thought that review bodies should have the authority to look at issues involving national security and how the RCMP dealt with issues of national security. In that respect, this new body for receiving civilian complaints does not have the same scope of power as the Security Intelligence Review Committee. 
One could argue that things could have been pushed a little further in that respect. One could also argue that the commissioner would have an obligation to implement 100% of the recommendations of the civilian review commission or of the external review committee.
 We could argue that point, but based on what I said at the beginning of my speech, these may not be shortcomings because the commissioner must retain some leadership freedom. We do not feel that these shortcomings, if they are shortcomings, compel us to vote against the bill.",Liberal,Lac-Saint-Louis,Francis Scarpaleggia,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=4abeb9b5-279b-4117-9e04-b8901d9ccc53&Language=E&Section=ALL

On the question of sexual harassment, my recollection at committee is that the member supported our amendment to add sexual harassment to the bill. We said it should be added to the section on training. Therefore, instead of treating sexual harassment as a disciplinary matter, there would actually be a commitment in the RCMP to take it up as a training matter and improve the workplace at the front end rather than punishing people at the back end on the question of sexual harassment.

So, it is an honour for me to rise today as the official opposition deputy critic for public safety to defend the NDP's position and explain why we will vote against Bill C-42.
Before I get into the substance of my remarks about processes and what happened in committee, I want to say it was a real pleasure and honour for me to work on Bill C-42. This gave me the opportunity to meet members of the RCMP, and I made friends along the way. I met courageous men and women who poured their heart out to explain their position on the bill. Today, I want to sincerely thank them for doing so. They have enabled me to learn more about the RCMP, which is not present in Quebec. That is why we are somewhat less familiar with it, even though it is a national police force.
The NDP supported Bill C-42 at second reading so that this legislation would be studied in committee, because we had many questions about it. We felt that a lot of work remained to be done on this bill. At the time, I very much appreciated the Minister of Public Safety's speech, particularly when he said he was open to amendments from all sides of the House. For us, it meant that the door was wide open to improve a bill that really deserved to be examined. It was also a way of showing Canadians that, regardless of the side of the House on which we sit, we can work together to ensure that bills are the best they can be once we have reviewed them in committee and returned them to the House.
As I mentioned earlier, we supported Bill C-42 at second reading and we were very pleased to study it in committee. In this regard, the first thing I want to mention is that the committee had very little time. Sometimes, we even had to invite several witnesses at once. This meant that we could not ask them very many questions, which was quite unfortunate. Bill C-42 is huge and it deals with many provisions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. We therefore did not have time to update this legislation, even though it would have been necessary. I was deeply saddened that the debate was cut short. We did what we could with what we had. We tried to work with that.
The second point I want to mention is the time allocated for committee review. Some RCMP members who worked on a similar bill over 20 years ago told us that, the last time the government amended the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, the process took over 10 years. By contrast, we had only a few weeks. I think we worked too quickly. However, that is not really a problem since at least we are still here today to spend a little more time on this legislation. 
I also found it sad that none of the amendments proposed by the opposition were accepted. The only amendments that were accepted were those proposed by the government. What I found even sadder was that most of these amendments had to do with correcting spelling or translation mistakes. They were not substantive amendments. They merely sought to correct spelling mistakes and typos. It seems as though the bill was drafted in a rush, on the back of a napkin, and that the government then wanted to correct the mistakes it found. That was also a sad thing to see.
Unfortunately, the Conservatives did not take a serious look at the points made by witnesses in their testimony. That is the work that we, as the official opposition, decided to do regarding Bill C-42. We really wanted to take a closer look at what witnesses told the committee, and we wanted to work with them to make substantial and important amendments to give more substance to the bill.
Today, we are back in the House and, considering that none of our amendments were accepted and that the work in committee was done so quickly, we cannot support this legislation. I will explain why a little later on in my speech. 
It is also important to mention that RCMP members were not consulted before Bill C-42 was drafted. My colleague, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, pointed this out at the beginning of his speech, and it is important to remember that. 
 They were presented with a fait accompli. They were told what was going to be done and what would be introduced. The government did not even deign to ask the members of our national police force what they thought. I am extremely disappointed about this.
 Again this morning, I spoke with members of the RCMP. In particular, I spoke with Mr. Gaétan Delisle, who represents the Quebec Mounted Police Members' Association and is someone who has filed several hundred grievances for RCMP members from all parts of Canada. In fact, he is still doing so strongly and passionately. 
 We talked about some of the clauses in the bill. It can be quite difficult to understand what is in this bill.
 We looked at clauses 31.3 and 31.4, and we had a hard time figuring out what they involved. Eventually, we figured out that these clauses really had to do with the grievance process and the possibility of using notes, reports and other material in filing a grievance. 
 Bill C-42 does not deal just with sexual harassment. I would also like to mention here, for the information of members who do not sit on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, that a very large part of Bill C-42 involves workers' rights.
 From now on, they will not be able to use certain important notes or documents in filing their grievances. This applies specifically to one particular case in the RCMP's code of ethics, which says a member cannot disobey a lawful command, except if he can prove that the command is illegal or breaks a law. 
 Without access to certain documents, notes or reviews as evidence, it cannot be proven that such a command may be illegal, at the end of the day. This is a huge protection for workers that is being taken away, and I think it is totally wrong. We were told in committee that Bill C-42 took rights away from workers. I still cannot believe that no one has been able to remedy the situation. 
 However, what can we do? This is the way things are; we do not have a majority. 
 Because I cannot raise all the issues in Bill C-42 that should be discussed, I want to talk about sexual harassment. In this bill, which is supposed to resolve the sexual harassment issue, there is no reference to harassment or sexual harassment.
 This is incredible. In fact, this is one of the reasons why we are moving a motion to remove clause 1, the title, because it has no connection with the content of the bill. 
 Credible witnesses appeared before the committee to give us their views on sexual harassment in the RCMP. As I mentioned earlier, the Quebec Mounted Police Members' Association told us how important it was to mention it in the bill. That would have helped to protect workers in the RCMP, but it was not done.
 The committee also met with Ms. Séguin of Quebec's Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harcèlement sexuel au travail. She spoke passionately about her work, which involves protecting employees who are victims of harassment, regardless of their line of work. She was shocked that there was absolutely no mention of sexual harassment in the bill. 
 We in the official opposition tried to propose amendments of substance to remedy the situation. Some of our amendments sought to make it mandatory for all members of the RCMP to take training on harassment, in connection with the RCMP Act. Part of the work should have involved education and helping RCMP members do that work.
 In conclusion, I hope that I am asked a number of interesting questions because I still have so many things to say about Bill C-42. That being said, I have to reiterate that, unfortunately, for these reasons, we will be unable to vote in favour of Bill C-42.",New Democratic Party,Alfred-Pellan,Rosane Doré Lefebvre,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=8b25c8e3-9469-45c8-9995-ecdf3f119c0c&Language=E&Section=ALL

In fact, my recollection was there was at least one meeting where we all finished asking questions of the witnesses and had a bit of time left. We were given ample opportunity to ask fulsome questions and we received great feedback from the witnesses.
My question, though, for the hon. member is this. We have talked at length about the issue of sexual harassment, how to deal with it and the attempts this bill makes to modernize the RCMP so it can deal with sexual harassment. We also talked at length about how no government had recognized, even my hon. colleague on the Liberal side when his party was in government, that bills do not have this level of detail of using terms like harassment or sexual harassment. It is not the norm. 
After hearing that, would the NDP reconsider its position? I understand that maybe the members did not realize that.

The bill does not deal with sexual harassment at all, or very little. The fact that the words are not even mentioned in the bill shows that the government could not care less about addressing the issue.
Regarding sexual harassment in the RCMP, what intrigues me about the Conservatives' approach is its complete lack of consistency.
On November 8, 2012, a motion was put forward in the Senate by a Conservative senator. The motion requested the production of a report on harassment in the RCMP. On the one hand, they present this kind of motion, and on the other, they introduce a bill that pretends to address sexual harassment in the RCMP.

The NDP put forward amendments. What can we do? It really is a problem: there have been very serious cases of sexual harassment in the RCMP. Something must be done.
How would the NDP tackle this very serious problem?",New Democratic Party,Pontiac,Mathieu Ravignat,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c3000ffc-065c-47e0-be26-152a24090dbd&Language=E&Section=ALL

This is indeed a very serious problem, not just in the RCMP but in any workplace. Sexual harassment in the workplace is not part of the job. It is not something that should happen on the job. We should be opposed to harassment, no matter where it happens. Naming the problem is a very important way to acknowledge that it exists.
I am not saying that there are huge numbers of sexual harassment cases in the RCMP. I am saying that we have to tackle problems as they are and with the right kinds of tools. My colleague asked an excellent question.
Among other things, people in the RCMP need to be educated and should be asked to take training on harassment. A number of issues could have been resolved in this bill, and I would like to come back to what was mentioned earlier. For instance, a completely independent civilian body should be set up to take care of complaints within the RCMP. The police should not be investigating the police, especially in cases of sexual harassment.
Many of the amendments that were presented were designed to solve the problem and ensure progress toward transparency, independence, and a more modern RCMP. Unfortunately, the Conservatives voted against every one of our amendments.",New Democratic Party,Alfred-Pellan,Rosane Doré Lefebvre,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=8b25c8e3-9469-45c8-9995-ecdf3f119c0c&Language=E&Section=ALL

Surrey has the largest RCMP detachment in the country. The men and women who work in my city, RCMP members and civilian members who work with them, do a wonderful job. Not only that, my office meets with them on a regular basis to deal with some of the local issues that come up in my constituency. I am very thankful to them for providing that wonderful service to the citizens in Surrey.
First, it should be a priority of the House and the government to restore public confidence in the RCMP. A functioning, effective RCMP that holds the public trust is critical to building safer communities across the country.
On this side of the House, we support the stated intent of the bill and we hoped to make some amendments in committee that would address some of our concerns. I will talk about that a little later on, as to what happened. I have stood in the House, time after time, and called on the government to step up and deal with problems that years of Conservative mismanagement have caused in our national police force.
The goals stated in the preamble of the bill, transparency, improving conduct, strengthening the review and complaints body and dealing with the climate of sexual harassment that exists in the RCMP, are all good goals. We hoped that we could make some amendments at the committee stage to improve the bill and make it more effective, so we could deal with the issues the RCMP had been dealing with for a number of years.
For those reasons, we supported the second reading of the bill, because we thought we would actually get to address some of those real issues plaguing the RCMP. Unfortunately, every amendment the NDP put forward in committee to improve upon the very things I talked about were turned down, without even simple consideration.
We would have thought that maybe one amendment might have made sense to them. We have seen this in many other committees. I sit on the international trade committee, as well as other committees, including the public safety committee. Not one amendment from the opposition, out of the thousands and thousands of amendments that have been brought forward in committees, has been accepted by the Conservative government.
One would think that out of the thousands of ideas we have presented maybe one would fit the Conservative ideology, but that is not the case. It is very unfortunate. This was an opportunity for the Conservatives to right the wrong of the mismanagement of the RCMP over the last six or seven years. This just did not happen.
The reputation and the respect of the RCMP has been built over the years, but let us look at what has happened over the last six or seven years. The Conservatives have totally mismanaged those issues.
One of the amendments that the opposition put forward basically added mandatory harassment training for RCMP members, specifically through the RCMP Act. Another amendment we brought forward was to ensure a fully independent civilian review body to investigate complaints against the RCMP.
In my province of British Columbia, that has been an ongoing issue, where the police investigate themselves. Canadians deserve clarity on this. Conservatives have the opportunity in this bill to bring that in to help Canadians have the RCMP be accountable and transparent. Again, the Conservatives have, and I hate to use these words, missed the bus on this part of the amendment.
We wanted to add provisions to create a national civilian investigation body that would avoid police investigating police. We also wanted to create a more balanced human resources policy by removing some of the more draconian powers proposed for the RCMP Commissioner and by strengthening the external review committee in cases involving possible dismissal form the force.
What did the Conservatives do? Again, they voted down every single one of those amendments. Those amendments would have provided some form of clarity and transparency to Canadians. Yet the Conservatives chose not to accept any of those recommendations or committee amendments.
The Conservative government is ignoring calls for more balance and standing by its argument that putting more power in the hands of the RCMP commissioner to fire individual officers would curb ongoing issues at the RCMP and that the RCMP commissioner should have the final say on all dismissals. Expert witness after expert witness explained that the legislation alone would not help to foster a more open and respectable workforce for all and that the concentration of power in the hands of the commissioner is part of the problem, not the solution. We need to see an ongoing effort from the RCMP and the government to modernize the RCMP, and the bill would lack the transparency and accountability necessary for that change. 
Basically, the bill would not go far enough. My colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and a number of other NDP members have called upon the government to be more transparent and more accountable. The Conservatives had this opportunity to make the RCMP, our national police force, more accountable and more transparent, yet again they missed the opportunity. My colleagues have also talked about having a safe work environment for the men and women who work in our force. Clearly, the Conservatives have missed that opportunity. 
It is clear that sexual harassment is not only a problem, it is a symptom. It is endemic to the internal culture of the RCMP. The Conservatives' approach would not make women in the RCMP a priority, which is necessary if we want to deal substantially with this problem. My primary concern is that, over and over, we see the Conservatives attempting to gloss over the real issues within the RCMP. They implement quick fixes instead of truly taking the steps necessary to fix the force for the sake of those serving in the force, and to restore public confidence in the RCMP ultimately for the safety of our communities.
The scope of the problem of sexual harassment in the RCMP is massive. More than 200 women, both current and former RCMP officers, are seeking a class action suit against the RCMP on the grounds of sexual harassment. That does not include the individual lawsuits that could be filed by them. My NDP colleagues and I pushed for the minister for months to prioritize the issue of sexual harassment in the RCMP. Unfortunately, Bill C-42 would not directly address the systemic issues in the culture of the RCMP. It is clear that the bill by itself would not change the current climate in the RCMP.
I have a lot to speak about on this particular issue, but in summary I will say a few things. The Conservatives had an opportunity to fix the RCMP, to address the issues of sexual harassment and of transparency and accountability. They have clearly not taken advantage of the opportunity to do that. I stress that in my community of Surrey and in communities across the country, crime and violence are a reality. A few weeks ago in the Lower Mainland, a known gang member was shot and killed in broad daylight. 
This kind of violence is unacceptable, but instead of investing in measures to prevent crime in our communities by supporting the work of the RCMP, the Conservatives are making it harder for police to do their jobs. We have come to know that 42 RCMP office support staff in B.C. have received notices stating that they could lose their jobs.
We need to be supporting the work of the RCMP, not making its job harder. The government has put forward a bill that seems to finally acknowledge some of these problems, but it simply does not address the major issues that we need to address. An effective RCMP is a matter of public safety and real action is long overdue. The Conservatives have failed Canadians again.",New Democratic Party,Surrey North,Jasbir Sandhu,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=8e00cb1e-2b6e-4836-8664-f50de4a195c2&Language=E&Section=ALL

It is very disappointing to see the NDP once again oppose an important piece of legislation that would give the RCMP the tools that it needs to fight things such as sexual harassment. The NDP is introducing this amendment to change the short title of the bill, which is enhancing RCMP accountability, which is appropriate. It is not called making perfect the RCMP or fixing all problems within the RCMP or there will never be any other issues within the RCMP. Those are not the title. The title is enhancing accountability. The bill is a balanced and practical approach that would give the RCMP the tools that it needs to help change some of the things that need to be changed within the organization.

The member talked about accountability and transparency. Accountability and transparency have to start with the Conservative government, which has not been accountable and transparent at all.

This is probably my last speech in the House in 2012. 
In my previous speech on Bill C-42, I said I was pleased with the introduction of this legislation in the House. The issue of harassment is a public and urgent concern for Canadians. We put a lot of pressure on the Department of Public Safety to make the issue of sexual harassment in the RCMP a priority. That is why we supported this bill at second reading, in the hope of improving it and proposing amendments in committee to make it acceptable and efficient, so as to adequately tackle the issue of sexual harassment.
The first version of the bill did not deal directly with this systemic problem, which is deeply rooted in RCMP corporate culture. The wording of the bill introduced at first reading would not have changed the existing climate within the RCMP.
When the bill was drafted, the Minister of Public Safety did not seem to take into consideration the various recommendations of the Task Force on Governance and Cultural Change in the RCMP. As I mentioned, we still supported the bill at second reading to properly study it and improve it in committee. Unfortunately, the study in committee did not go very well. I am really disappointed by the government's lack of co-operation on this issue.
The Conservatives did not really want to co-operate with us to ensure a balanced representation of the various views and positions. The government presented 12 witnesses to the committee, while we could only have seven. Moreover, in my opinion, the Conservatives' witnesses were not completely independent. All but one of the witnesses, who represented the government or the RCMP, presented the government's position without any real nuances. We feel the witnesses selected by the Conservatives did not come to express a completely independent opinion. 
The Conservatives were also in no hurry to call the witnesses that we wanted to appear before the committee. The first witness was called to appear only at the fourth meeting, and most of our witnesses were called only on the last day scheduled to hear evidence. In a way, the Conservatives forced us to present all our amendments on the last day scheduled to hear our witnesses. They also asked us to present our amendments three and a half hours later, on the same day. That did not leave us much time to assess and examine the recommendations made by witnesses.
We also wanted to table amendments, based on the witnesses' recommendations, in order to make the legislation much more effective, so that it would achieve its objective. Such behaviour on the part of the Conservatives is totally unacceptable and impedes the work of Parliament.
We also proposed a number of amendments that were rejected by government members without any discussion. We proposed to include mandatory training on harassment for RCMP members in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, but that was also rejected. The Conservatives simply do not want to hear a dissenting opinion, or even recognize its validity. 
 The director of the Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harcèlement sexuel au travail de la province de Québec appeared before the committee and said: “With the 32 years of experience we have, we have found out that when companies do have a clear policy, when employees do know what is acceptable and not acceptable, it makes it much easier for management to deal with the problems.” But the Conservatives preferred to ignore this important testimony.
It is also disappointing that the minister did not ask for a clear policy on sexual harassment in the RCMP, with specific standards of conduct and criteria for assessing the performance of all employees. Such a policy is necessary to provide a basis for a much fairer disciplinary process. The director of the Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harcèlement sexuel au travail de la province de Québec also spoke eloquently on the importance of such a policy.
 They chose to ignore her evidence and stubbornly insisted on a magic solution that will not resolve all the RCMP's problems. 
 We too put forward an amendment that would guarantee the independence of the body set up to investigate complaints in the RCMP. Once again, the answer was no. We also proposed adding provisions to establish a civilian investigative body, to stop the police from investigating themselves. Once again, this amendment was thrown out. Yet all Canadians are asking for such a provision. Trust in police investigations has to be rebuilt. When a police force investigates another police force, there may well be a conflict of interest or a perceived conflict of interest.
 If the Conservatives do not want to listen to Canadians, perhaps they will listen to a former commissioner of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission. He believes that the bill is not in line with the review procedures established by Justice O'Connor and that it will not meet the needs of Canadians or the RCMP.
 I would like to remind the House that Justice O'Connor mentioned in the Arar inquiry that it was important for Parliament to set up an oversight agency for the RCMP. It would appear that his recommendations have simply been gathering dust. 
 The bill would give the RCMP commissioner new authority, the authority to decide on appropriate disciplinary measures. This would include the authority to appoint and dismiss members as he chooses. 
 During my initial speech, I also said that the approach by the public safety department was a simplistic solution to a much bigger problem: they were just giving the commissioner final authority for dismissing employees. This is why we proposed an amendment to create police forces that were better balanced in terms of human resources, by removing some of the more extreme powers held by the RCMP commissioner and by strengthening those of the external review committee in cases of possible dismissal from the RCMP.
 As I said earlier, while Bill C-42 may give the commissioner greater authority to set up a more effective process for resolving harassment complaints, and greater authority over disciplinary matters, it cannot provide the RCMP with the genuine cultural change that it needs to eliminate not only sexual harassment, but also cases relating more generally to the discipline and behaviour of RCMP officers. 
 Commissioner Paulson himself stated that legislative measures alone would not be enough to retain the public's trust, and that far-reaching reforms would be needed to address the serious underlying issues in the RCMP and foster a work environment that is more open, more co-operative and more respectful for all.
 It is obvious to the NDP that the department lacked leadership with regard to dealing with the broader issue the RCMP is facing. Commissioner Paulson told the Standing Committee on the Status of Women that the issue goes well beyond sexual harassment. This situation must change. I believe that the minister should have taken the extensive experience of the RCMP commissioner into account. 
 In conclusion, if the Conservative government really wanted to modernize the RCMP, it would have agreed to implement the recommendations from the oversight agencies and proceed with an audit of the RCMP by a group of independent auditors that would have reported directly to Parliament. NDP members attempted to amend the bill so that it would deal with issues raised in the evidence heard, but the Conservatives refused to get on board.",New Democratic Party,Châteauguay--Saint-Constant,Sylvain Chicoine,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d76f3534-c5d6-48cc-812f-00d8be4017ef&Language=E&Section=ALL

Was he talking about harassment complaints filed by RCMP employees?
Unfortunately, we found that the harassment of female RCMP officers by male officers is a major problem, and that female officers probably have some difficulty being heard and breaking the silence. Will the proposed legislation improve these people's lives? We doubt it.
Instead of giving this mandate to police forces, it would have been much wiser to create a civilian investigative body to deal with these issues, listen to female officers and investigate sexual harassment complaints. Female officers would probably be much more comfortable with this type of structure.
The establishment of a totally independent civilian investigative body would certainly have been more appropriate for dealing with this type of whistle-blowing and would have helped officers who may find it hard to report a fellow officer to do so confidentially.",New Democratic Party,Châteauguay--Saint-Constant,Sylvain Chicoine,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d76f3534-c5d6-48cc-812f-00d8be4017ef&Language=E&Section=ALL

Peter Van Loan (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, CPC)",,Private Members' Business,Business of the House,,"Mr. Speaker, I rise with tidings of good cheer. That means no NDP carbon tax this year and that we have much else for which to be thankful.
First, I thank everyone in the precinct and back in our constituencies who have helped make 2012 such a productive year for all members of Parliament. We have had a busy but quite productive year in the House. In fact, by the end of this week I anticipate that Parliament will have seen 35 government bills complete the legislative steeplechase.
We have had some interesting days and even a couple of memorable nights in the House in 2012.
Let me thank you. Mr. Speaker, and your entire team of chair occupants, as well as the clerks at the table. You have all been very busy with lots of votes and other interesting action.
Just as important are all the other support staff who are not here in the chamber. I thank them as well for all their efforts in the past year.
I also want to thank our team of pages who are about to have a well-deserved rest from their studies and their work here. I am sure their time with us means that each one of them will be taking at least one interesting story back home for the holidays, but before that they should ensure to study hard for those remaining exams.
I have appreciated working with the two hon. members who are my opposition counterparts, as well as their own predecessors. One moved from a role as a very constructive and positive House leader to become a leader of his party and another is now seeking to repeat the same move in the Liberal Party.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank the Conservative team as well for their support in advancing our government's agenda through the House.
I hope everyone will have the chance to have a restful break over Christmas and then a fruitful month connecting with constituents in January.
I am looking forward to 2013 being another hard-working, orderly and productive year in the House of Commons.
I believe the House leaders of the other parties have a few comments to add.
Following those remarks, Mr. Speaker, I believe you would find unanimous consent to dispose of a motion which reflects the fact that the work plan we agreed to as House leaders for this week has been implemented on an expedited basis. Therefore, I do anticipate you will find unanimous support for this motion after the other House leaders speak.
I move:
 That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practices of the House, during the debate this day pursuant to Standing Order 66(2) on the motion to concur in the Seventh Report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Chair shall not receive any quorum calls, dilatory motions, requests for unanimous consent, or amendments; and that at the end of the time remaining for the debate, or when no member rises to speak, all questions necessary to dispose of the motion be deemed put and a recorded division be deemed requested; and 
And the important part of the motion reads as follows:
 That when the House adjourns today, it shall stand adjourned until January 28, 2013, provided that, for the purposes of Standing Order 28, it shall be deemed to have sat on Thursday, December 13 and Friday December 14, 2012.

I look forward to working with all of you. I should also say that I will be splitting my time with the member for Newmarket—Aurora.
Over the past year, we have all observed the ongoing blood-letting by the Assad regime in Syria. Since we last debated this issue in this very chamber, the situation on the ground has deteriorated with Assad now making indiscriminate use of air power against his own cities. Violence on the ground continues to escalate, while the humanitarian and economic situation deteriorates daily.
Unfortunately, the devastating impact of the Syrian conflict is not only contained within Syria's borders, but is causing instability and insecurity throughout the region and across the globe. Every day an increasing number of refugees flee to countries, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Thousands of others have fled to Egypt and north Africa. 
Earlier this week, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that there were over half a million registered refugees. The actual number of refugees is estimated to be much higher. In addition, over 1.2 million individuals have been displaced inside Syria, and this number is expected to grow as the violence continues.
Canada is proud to be providing support to help address the needs of those affected by the ongoing violence. Just today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced an additional $10 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of those affected by the crisis in Syrian, including the thousands of refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries. This brings our total humanitarian assistance in response to the Syrian crisis to $22 million.
The minister also announced that Canada would be providing another $5 million in material support to Jordan to assist in handling the large influx of Syrian refugees. This is in addition to the $6.5 million that Canada committed this past summer for assistance to Jordan. Canada will also provide the Jordanian armed forces with $1.5 million worth of personal protective equipment to guard them against potential chemical weapons or biological incident arising from Syria.
It is, therefore, more for humanitarian reasons. and, in fact, the regional stability. that Canada will continue to work with the global community to end the crisis, and we must do it on two fronts.
First, we must work toward ending the financial and material support that continues to prop up the Assad regime, and we must do this through coordinated effective sanctions. Sanctions and other forms of external pressure, particularly from those in the region, are the only ways to cut out financial support for the Assad regime.
This is why our government has implemented 11 rounds of tough sanctions targeted against the Assad regime and its supporters. This is why the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and officials at all levels continue to take every opportunity, both bilaterally and at the United Nations, the G8 and the Friends of the Syrian people, for other nations to implement tough, effective sanctions against the Assad regime. We continue to raise this issue at every opportunity with Russia, with China and with those in the Middle East. 
If we eliminate material and financial support for the regime, we remove the tools that enable them to attack innocent civilians in a desperate attempt to hold on to power.
Second, the international community must also continue to work together to support the formation of a credible, viable and unified alternative to the Assad regime.
 It was for that reason that the minister was in Morocco today at the fourth meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People where he met the U.K. Foreign Secretary Hague and the leader of the newly formed Syrian National Coalition for opposition and revolutionary forces, Shaikh Moaz al-Khatib, a rebel leader who continues to take a proactive and responsible position on the crisis in Syria.
Today, the message to the new opposition coalition is to continue to reach out to all sectors of the Syrian opposition, especially those members of the opposition within Syria itself, and of all of Syria's diverse community. All Syrians will have a role to play in any successful post-Assad political foundation. 
As Canadians, we believe that people around the world seek the same universal goals of freedom and democracy. We all share aspirations for a better life and a opportunity for prosperity.
The pressure for freedom and opportunity is felt strongly throughout the region. If long-term security is to prevail, that pressure cannot be ignored or passed by. Even the most brutal tactics cannot quell the universal human aspiration for a better life.
Our government will continue to do what it can to protect and encourage those with the courage to stand for their rights. Canada will stand with those who seek to improve the lives of their people.",Conservative,Calgary East,Deepak Obhrai,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=9f0040ba-a9d7-4aa4-b2e4-f3213a4e024f&Language=E&Section=ALL

Maybe he can elaborate on some of the things he wanted to say in response to my questions.
I want to underline the fact that we are debating this subject in light of the report from the foreign affairs committee and a motion that was passed asking the government to do three things. The first was to provide more aid and assistance. There was an announcement today from the Minister of Foreign Affairs on that. However, I underline the point made at committee, which was that it should have included Turkey. It would be helpful to understand why Turkey was not one of the recipients in that announcement today. 
Second was to fast-track those who have family members here in Canada so that the refugees presently in camps in the border regions of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon might be able to come to Canada. I did not hear an announcement on that from the government. It was in our motion from the committee. I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary could tell us where the government stands on that. It was certainly something that was prioritized in the motion we passed at committee.
Finally, part of the committee report and the motion was that we support Mr. Brahimi's mission. Mr. Brahimi is the special UN envoy who is in Damascus trying to find some sort of agreement among all the parties.

The number of Bashar al-Assad's victims continues to rise, with over 40,000 people now estimated to have been killed since the outbreak of violence in March 2011. Earlier this week the United Nations High Commission for Refugees announced that the number of registered Syrian refugees had surpassed the half-million mark, and the actual number of refugees is estimated to be much higher.
Civilians are desperately fleeing the aerial bombardments, the artillery shells, and other forms of ongoing violence to neighbouring countries, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, which have generously been offering their support. Thousands of others have also fled to Egypt and North Africa. Over 1.2 million are reported to be internally displaced within Syria and this number is expected to rise as the violence continues unabated.
These stark numbers, which reflect the real human suffering that is a consequence of the conflict in Syria, coupled with the intensifying indiscriminate attacks of the Assad regime on civilians, make it painfully clear that Assad will cling desperately to power regardless of the cost to Syria and the Syrian people, regardless of what is right, regardless of how many lives are lost.
Canada has commended and continues to commend the generosity of neighbouring states and others in the region that have been left to deal with the impact of Assad's actions. These states have welcomed and are supporting those fleeing the violence in Syria. We recognize the immense pressure the influx of refugees is placing on host countries and communities and are working with our humanitarian partners to provide support to refugees and their host countries.
The humanitarian situation cannot be allowed to deteriorate further, and yet it will if nothing is done to address the ongoing violence. We call on all parties to allow free access to those providing humanitarian assistance for vulnerable populations.
The Assad regime must not be allowed to continue its abuses against its own people. The conflict must come to an end. A political transition must take place. The region must not be permitted to become inflamed in this mess caused and exacerbated by the Assad regime, which must be held to account for its murderous rampage against its own people, against its own civilians. The Syrian people have risked their lives for freedom and democracy. It is time for a new, responsible and democratic Syria with a free and inclusive society to take its place as a prosperous and peaceful agent for positive change in the Middle East.
To this end, Canada has repeatedly condemned the savagery of the Assad regime and continues to support the Syrian people in their valiant struggle for a better, brighter future. Our efforts to pressure Assad to end the oppression of his own people is multi-faceted. They are intended to maximize pressure on the regime while supporting the Syrian people.
We have now implemented 11 rounds of sanctions against Assad and his supporters, sanctions that target the regime, not the Syrian population. The Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and officials at all levels continue to press the international community at every available opportunity, particularly those who stand in the way of a solution to the crisis in Syria, including Russia and China, whom we have pressed to end their support for the regime and to support a transition of power. We continue to impress upon these nations and the Security Council that if we work together to cut off the financial and material support for the Assad regime, then it will crumble.
Canada is also leading the way in supporting a Syrian-led resolution to the crisis. We are encouraged by the newly formed Syrian National Coalition for Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Earlier today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was in Marrakesh, Morocco attending a meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People with foreign ministers, officials and opposition leaders. This is the fourth such meeting and the minister has actively participated in all of them.
When it comes to addressing the humanitarian situation caused by the conflict in Syria and helping those in need, Canada is there. We are providing direct support for the Syrians affected by the conflict, whose primary concerns are safety and survival, both for themselves and their loved ones.
 Just today, the minister announced Canada's contribution of an additional $10 million in humanitarian assistance to address the needs of those affected by the crisis in Syria, including the many refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries. This brings our total humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis to $22 million.
 We remain concerned about the ongoing crisis in Syria. The population in this state of crisis has immense and urgent requirements, the most immediate being safety, food, shelter, water and basic health services. Compounding this is the arrival of cold weather in the region.
CIDA is providing support to international organizations to not only ensure a coordinated response but also to ensure the needs of refugees in such sectors as protection, water and sanitation, nutritious food, and basic medical care are met. This support includes Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. The minister also announced that Canada is providing another $5 million in material support to Jordan to assist in handling the large influx of Syrian refugees. This is in addition to the $6.5 million Canada committed this past summer for assistance to Jordan.
Syria remains a daunting international and regional challenge. The stakes are very high in both human and political terms. As the death toll continues to rise, and as the risk to regional stability continues to mount, Canada and the wider international community are faced with the demand for action.
The situation cannot go on indefinitely. Canada will continue to work with its international partners and the people of Syria in the search for solutions that address the immediate suffering of the Syrian people and can bring an end to the conflict.
We will remain engaged and committed.",Conservative,Newmarket--Aurora,Lois Brown,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b7266d04-f318-4305-ab9f-580a06be7d08&Language=E&Section=ALL

One is around the fast-tracking of claimants who have family members here but are presently in refugee camps in the bordering regions, which she underlined, around Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. We still have not heard from the government as to whether it will commit to that. This is different from what the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism announced, which was to simply deal with the files that they had.
Are they going to in fact get going on the fast-tracking of those who wish to join family members here in Canada? That is what we have done in the past, in Haiti and other places where there have been crises.
Second, just to clarify, there have been news reports today of comments by the Minister of Foreign Affairs about supporting the initiatives in Marrakesh, but there has not been a full endorsement of the opposition. I just want to get a sense from the parliamentary secretary about exactly what the government's policy is.

We will be making our own decision.
We are encouraged by steps the opposition has made to become more accountable. For more than a year, our government has been encouraging the Syrian opposition to come together. We applaud them. We congratulate them on the recent announcement that they made. We believe that it really does present a major step forward.
To be really successful, we know that this opposition is going to have to demonstrate that they have the support of all of those religious minorities that are present in Syria. That includes the Christians, the Kurds, the Alawites, the Druze and many other groups who are present there. Although we believe that this is a good step forward, there are still many things that need to be taken under consideration.

Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.)",,Routine Proceedings,Committees of the House,Foreign Affairs and International Development,"Mr. Speaker, a couple of months ago we had an emergency debate on Syria. I rose in the House and said that there was a letter I had sent to the minister regarding matching donations dollar for dollar. The parliamentary secretary at the time, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other members were jumping up and down saying, “Table the letter”. Unfortunately I was not allowed to table the letter, as some members would not allow me to table it.
However, since then we have written to the minister, clearly, publicly, asking the government to work with the Canadian-Syrian diaspora to match, dollar for dollar, the money they raise. They have raised quite a few million dollars.
What has changed from the time they were jumping up and down saying, “Show us the letter”, to when the letter went public? Why are they not, right now, moving forward on matching what the community has raised dollar for dollar, and making sure that they address that issue? That is what I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary.",Liberal,Scarborough--Agincourt,Jim Karygiannis,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=176fea8a-f126-4725-b119-187ba46a9413&Language=E&Section=ALL

Our government is taking action. We have provided humanitarian assistance and are working with our partners in Syria to ensure that humanitarian assistance gets to the people who need it. We are working to provide money for the neighbouring countries where many of the refugees are headed. We want to ensure they have the medical and food supplies they need. 
It is a horrible situation, but that is why our government has taken action. To date, we have provided $22 million. With the minister having announced the additional funds today, we are working hard to see the humanitarian contributions made.",Conservative,Newmarket--Aurora,Lois Brown,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b7266d04-f318-4305-ab9f-580a06be7d08&Language=E&Section=ALL
4550512,ca.proc.d.2012-12-12.14943.367,2012-12-12,176fea8a-f126-4725-b119-187ba46a9413,150,"Hon. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.)",,Routine Proceedings,Committees of the House,Foreign Affairs and International Development,"Mr. Speaker, the civil war in Syria began in early 2011 with Syrians gathering to call for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights. They also called for an end to the emergency law, which has been in place since 1962. The demonstration and clashes with police have deteriorated into an all-out civil war and calls for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. 
Since August, 2011, the Government of Canada has initiated a series of increasing sanctions. These sanctions range from freezing the assets of Syrian individuals to the prohibition of import or export of goods and services, except for food. Unfortunately, these sanctions do not have any effect on members of the al-Assad regime.
On October, 2011, I proposed a motion in the House, which read: 
 That this House condemn the brutal attacks on members of the Syrian movement for democratic change and accountable government by the Bashar al-Assad regime; call on the Bashar al-Assad regime to meet the Arab League 15-day deadline to enact a cease-fire and to begin a dialogue between government officials and opposition representatives; accept the United Nations Human Rights Council’s commission of inquiry into the violence in Syria to find out exactly what happened and to put an end to civilian deaths; and, ensure that all the perpetrators of these attacks are brought to justice and bear the full weight of the law. 
Unfortunately, members on the other side of the House did not see fit to support my motion. Over the past 21 months the people of Syria have watched their world dissolve around them. They have seen their homes and shops destroyed with bombs and gunfire. They have witnessed the deaths of their friends, neighbours and loved ones. They have waited in terror for the loved ones who have been arrested and taken to one of the 27 torture centres. When the fear and waiting finally take their toll, hundreds of thousands have fled to neighbouring countries.
Syrian Canadians are calling on their government to help their friends and loved ones in Syria. The Liberal Party of Canada and the Syrian Canadian Council are urging the government to match, dollar for dollar, moneys raised by the Syrian Canadian community through recognized charitable organizations. These moneys would help to provide food, shelter, blankets and medical aid to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that more than half a million Syrians have claimed refuge in the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and the North African countries. Many Syrians who have fled their homeland did not register with the UNHCR when they first left Syria, feeling that they could live on their own resources as the conflict would be short. Unfortunately, their resources are now running out and the host communities and/or their families can no longer support them. Also, more than 2.5 million Syrians inside Syria will be in need of humanitarian assistance as winter approaches.
I received the following email from Tarek. He wrote, “The Assad regime is still punishing Syrian people for demanding their freedom and basic rights.... It is targeting schools, mosques, shopping areas and, most importantly, bakeries. In the second largest city in Syria, Aleppo, people are pleading with the world for any supply of wheat, flour and food”.
I received another email from Selma. She wants Canada to make a commitment to protect refugees and internally displaced people. This includes the commitment of humanitarian aid to refugees in refugee camps in surrounding countries. She writes, “The threat of infectious disease also continues to grow with the conflict. As a result, aid must also include medical support [a]nd support specifically for women who have faced sexual violence, as this is a continuing trauma”.
Canadians are a generous people and in times of crisis they dig deep to help their fellow man. All Canadians want is a little leadership from their government. It is time for the government to step up to the plate and give Canadians a vehicle to help those who are suffering in Syria. When will the Conservative government match, dollar for dollar, the money that has been and is being raised by the Syrian Canadian community to help the people of Syria?
The seventh report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development states, in part, that the committee “supports the Government’s efforts to expedite family reunification for Syrians who are sponsored by Syrian-Canadians and who face individualized personal risk”. 
In answer to a question on Friday, December 7, the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism stated in part, “we have accelerated some 200 applications that were outstanding for family reunification by Canadians who have made applications for reunification of Syrian nationals”.
The committee was not only supporting the government's acceleration of existing applications, but was calling for the government to expedite new family reunification applications for individuals who faced personal risk and were sponsored by Syrian Canadians.
After the 2004 tsunami, the Liberal government established a protocol to be used in case of natural or man-made disasters. The most important tenets of the protocol were, “To fast-track immigration to Canada of family-class individuals whose applications were being processed by Citizenship and Immigration Canada and to fast track to Canada family-class applications for individuals from the area affected by the natural or man-made disasters” and “To issue Visitor Visas to immediate family members from the affected area so they can join their relatives in Canada, on a temporary basis”.
The government used this protocol in the wake of the earthquakes in Haiti and China. Why will it not use it now?
I have received a number of emails from concerned Syrian Canadians. I would like to read some of them into the record.
 Noura writes, “The most important step...is to facilitate the re-unification and the sponsorship of families who have loved ones suffering in the warstricken area. The new Syria will not forget the countries and people who have helped it in its pursuit for freedom, dignity, fairness and the right to live an honourable life”.
Selma wants Canada to help by, “Allowing Syrian refugees to enter Canada as refugees as it is apparent the Syrian state structure has collapsed and there is no argument to support that citizens of Syria are safe where they are”.
Rami writes, “I call on the Canadian government to help ease the process of transition for Syrians applying for student permits by providing emergency grant funding to assist them in making the transition. Efforts are already underway with groups such as Jusoor trying to establish sponsorship programs for Syrian students applying to continue their education in Canada”.
Motaz just asks a simple question, “Why don't we open our door to accept some of the refugees?”
I wish I could answer Motaz's question, but I cannot. Maybe the minister can. Canada has a long history of opening its doors to refugees. 
In recent history, we have opened our doors to: 12,000 Czech refugees after the Prague Spring; 13,000 Chileans fleeing the persecution and the authoritarian rule of General Pinochet; 20,000 Soviet Jewish refugees who were being denied the right to express and practise their religion; 4,420 Ugandan Asian refugees following Idi Amin's expulsion of Asians from Uganda; 60,000 Vietnamese boat people; 5,000 Bosnian Muslims who were victims of the Yugoslavian civil war, which was characterized by ethnic cleansing and genocide; 5,500 Albanian Kosovar; 3,900 Karen refugees from Burma; and almost 4,000 Iraqi refugees.
What is the government waiting for? The government does not seem to have an answer. In fact, it does not seem to be any logical answer. Canadians want their government to act. They want their government to show some leadership in this situation.
Selma, who I mentioned earlier, further writes, “Canada has a legacy of being an international protector. We have lost that recently but we can try to regain that for the sake of the preservation of humanity. Canada has relatively good relations with China and Russia, two supporters of the current Syrian regime. The Canadian government should use such relations to mobilize the international community against the actions of Bashar al-Assad”.
Over its term in office, the government has almost always come late to the party. Its retreat from the international stage has cost Canada dearly. We were unable to gain a seat on the United Nations Security Council and this has limited our ability to influence members of the international community.
Unfortunately, Russia and China, two permanent members of the Security Council, have continuously voted against applying any sanctions against the al-Assad regime. This has ensured that the international community must stand by and watch the regime murder its citizens.
The right to protest and voice one's dissent is guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
One Canadian woman who was born in Syria has become an outspoken activist online. She has protested, posted updates and made comments against the al-Assad regime. Unable to silence her, the al-Assad regime has taken her brother into custody in Syria to be questioned about his sister's political activities. His family does not know where he was taken. While the al-Assad regime cannot actively silence a Canadian citizen, it is using the implied threat of detention and torture of her family members to silence her.
 How many other Canadian citizens are having their charter rights denied by the Syrian regime because they fear for the safety of their loved ones? Will the government take the principled stand and recognize the Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people?
Once again, Canada is late coming to the table. Of the 193 United Nations member states, more than 100 have recognized the Syrian opposition coalition. Today, the United States recognized the Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, who are signalling to the coalition that radical groups cannot play a part in Syria's eventual political transition. Canada has not done so. We are waiting because the minister has some concerns about the opposition, including its ability to send clear messages, to include religious minorities, and the minister also insists that no extremist groups be involved with the coalition. The minister has no hesitation about continuing to recognize the al-Assad regime, which is sending a clear message to the world that it will hang on at all costs. If that means bombing men, women and children, so be it. When will the government get its priorities straight?
Members of the Syrian National Council and the Syrian Canadian Council met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs in July. During their meeting, they asked the government to do the following:
 1. Expedite the processing of family members sponsored by Syrian-Canadians and Syrian permanent residents in Canada, giving priority to those displaced or in refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. 
 2. Accord priority processing to already submitted immigration applications from persons normally residing in areas affected by the fighting especially those who have been displaced. 
 3. Canada to admit a limited number of political refugees who face grave danger in Syria and in the surrounding countries, especially those with family members in Canada. 
 4. Canada to facilitate issuing temporary resident permits to the families of Canadians of a Syrian background living in Syria and neighboring countries, especially those who need protection against retributions by the Syrian regime. 
 5. In keeping with measures undertaken in similar circumstances in the past, permit Syrian temporary residents in Canada to remain in Canada and to take employment to enable them to support themselves. If the situation in Syria is not resolved within a reasonable period, it would be consistent with Canada‘s humanitarian Immigrations practices to permit such persons to apply for permanent residence in Canada. 
The Syrian Canadian Council and the Syrian National Council have requested a meeting with the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism. They are waiting for an answer. When will the minister meet to address their concerns? When will the government take all possible steps to help the citizens of Syria?",Liberal,Scarborough--Agincourt,Jim Karygiannis,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=176fea8a-f126-4725-b119-187ba46a9413&Language=E&Section=ALL
4550513,ca.proc.d.2012-12-12.14943.368,2012-12-12,9d1e4c91-5600-4728-a706-d812d6695e8b,585,"Mr. Bob Dechert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, CPC)",,Routine Proceedings,Committees of the House,Foreign Affairs and International Development,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and participate in this evening's very important debate on the situation in Syria. As all members know, the events that have unfolded there over the last year are no less than a tremendous human tragedy. Bashar al-Assad, a brutal dictator who is waging war against his own people, is now resorting to indiscriminate aerial attacks against Syrian cities. Tens of thousands are estimated to have been killed, more than half a million refugees have been forced to flee Syria's borders, and 1.2 million people have been displaced internally. Sadly, these numbers are expected to rise as the violence continues unabated.
Today we debate a report that reflects testimony heard by the foreign affairs committee on the situation in Syria. As a member of that committee, I would like to express my appreciation to the officials, experts and members of the community who took the time to speak with us.
I will begin my remarks this evening by reflecting on the generosity of Syria's neighbours and others in the region who have opened their borders to the Syrian refugees fleeing the growing violence. We recognize the considerable burden this has placed on neighbouring states like Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, which have limited resources and capacity to support those who have fled to safety.
Our government remains extremely concerned that the violence in Syria could spill over its borders into neighbouring countries. In addition to incidents of cross-border fire and shelling, in June of this year we witnessed Syria's audacious downing of a Turkish military plane. In the strongest terms we condemn that aggressive and unjustified attack, and as a NATO ally we continue to stand with the Turkish people and their government.
At Turkey's request, most recently NATO allies agreed to augment Turkish air defence capabilities by deploying Patriot missile defence batteries. It is important to note that this deployment is purely defensive and not intended to enforce a no-fly zone. No one seeks the escalation or spread of the conflict in Syria, least of all Turkey or its NATO allies. Canada supports this request and we commend the restraint demonstrated by the Turkish government in the face of repeated provocations by the Assad regime. We have been in regular contact with the Turkish government and the Minister of Foreign Affairs has personally extended an offer of assistance on a number of occasions to the Foreign Minister of Turkey and the Turkish ambassador.
The situation in Syria also threatens the delicate stability of Lebanon, where we have seen repeated outbreaks of violence as a direct consequence of the Syrian conflict. There has been cross-border fire as Syrian forces have clashed with rebels. The recent gunfights between opposing factions in the north of the country are the result of long-standing tensions, but these incidents have increased in frequency and seriousness. A considerable influx of Syrian refugees has also strained the capacity of the Government of Lebanon to maintain stability.
In August, the minister met with Lebanon's Prime Minister and expressed Canada's sincere gratitude for the role Lebanon has played in hosting Syrians seeking asylum from the violence ravaging their homeland.
Meanwhile, Syria continues to receive military support from Iran, one of its few remaining allies. In doing so, Iran has demonstrated a reckless disregard not only for the welfare of the people of Syria but also regarding the risks of a proxy war, which could destabilize the entire region. This should come as no surprise: Regimes that rely upon force to retain power at home will rely upon force to advance their interests abroad. Canada has repeatedly condemned Iran's ruthless abuse of human rights within its borders, its interference in the affairs of its neighbours, its support for terrorism and its support for the tyrannical regime of Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, we are particularly concerned about the emergence of terrorist groups on the ground, including foreign fighters. Despite a shared antipathy toward the Assad regime, these actors should not be confused with those in the opposition who seek a peaceful, democratic future for their people. On the contrary, extremists are taking advantage of the current instability to gain a foothold, from which, following the fall of the Assad regime, they would seek to impose a vision antithetical to the very ideals the majority of the opposition are risking their lives for, the ideals of democracy and human rights, including the rights of women and ethnic and religious minorities.
Canada and the rest of the world are incredibly alarmed by recent reports suggesting that the Assad regime might consider the use of chemical weapons in the current conflict. As the Assad regime increasingly loses control over parts of its territory, we are gravely concerned that it could turn to such weapons in a last desperate attempt to cling to power.
We have been consistent and very clear. The international community will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime on the Syrian people. We urge those countries with leverage to do what they can to prevent the Syrian crisis from entering a dangerous new phase. Ultimately, Assad and his supporters will be held accountable.
The brutality and recklessness of Assad and his regime threatens not only the stability of the region but, first and foremost, the security of the Syrian people. We will not stand by in the face of injustice perpetrated against innocent men, women and children and the wanton destruction of the ancient heritage of a proud civilization. 
In May of this year, Canada expelled all Syrian diplomats in Canada in response to a ruthless massacre in the town of Houleh, which claimed 300 lives, including 49 children under the age of 10, according to the special representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. The representatives of a regime so cowardly that it would resort to the slaughter of innocent children are not welcome in Canada. 
Our government has imposed 11 rounds of tough sanctions on the Assad regime. These sanctions do not target the people of Syria, but Assad and his close allies. We stand steadfast with the Syrian people who have risked so much for freedom and democracy. We call on those who continue to support this despicable regime to abandon it and, instead, stand with their fellow Syrian men and women who are yearning for peace and freedom.
As both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have stated on numerous occasions, we continue to urge the UN Security Council to likewise adopt binding international sanctions that will increase the pressure on Assad to end the bloodshed. Again, we call on those countries in a position to influence Damascus to press the regime to abandon its violent path and allow an inclusive Syrian-led political transition to occur.
Canada will persist in these efforts, together with like-minded partners, to oppose the savagery of the Assad regime. The ongoing violence must stop immediately and the Syrian people must be free to realize for themselves a better and brighter future. 
Members can rest assured that our government and all Canadians continue to support the brave men and women of Syria in their struggle against repression.",Conservative,Mississauga--Erindale,Bob Dechert,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=9d1e4c91-5600-4728-a706-d812d6695e8b&Language=E&Section=ALL

As my colleague mentioned, the situation in the camps around the country, along with threats and fear of the use of chemical and biological weapons against civilians are very worrying. Just today, heavier weapons and more offensive weapons were used against the civilian population.
Aside from the fact that people are living in refugee camps outside of Syria, and beyond their fears for the future, the situation inside the country is still absolutely tragic. Even though options are difficult and limited from many points of view, there is one thing we could do: we could facilitate family reunification and set up a special program for Syria, as we have done for many other countries, such as Iraq and Haiti, so these people can quickly come to Canada.

People all over are worried right now. They are worried that the situation will spread and affect other countries in the area. But above all, this is an absolutely horrible and worrisome situation for Syrians themselves.
We are talking about 30,000 civilians who have been killed since the start of the events, countless people injured, homes destroyed, hunger, cold and fear. Fear is a very big factor in this situation.
I want to quote Mariam Hamou, from the Syrian community in London. When she appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, Ms. Hamou said:
Torture has been reported in every city and town and affects every family. I do not want to get into the chilling details of what goes on, but I will share with the House one story that just sends chills down my spine. Women are being systematically raped in Syria.
Beyond the dead and wounded, it is a matter of human rights violations and sheer terror. We must put an end to what is going on, as the member from Ottawa Centre said a little earlier in this debate. We must continue diplomatic efforts and put all the necessary pressure on both the countries that think like us and those that do not. We must also do more to help.
We were all pleased to learn today that Canada would increase assistance for refugee camps in the surrounding countries, and we hope that this assistance will continue, because the situation continues and is getting worse and worse with winter approaching. I will come back to this issue a bit later.
As for Syrians in Syria, I would like to quote Faisal Alazem, who lives in Montreal in my region. This is what he told the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development:
 Domestically, many members of the Syrian Canadian community are worried about the fate of their families in Syria or those exiled out of Syria, and they therefore request that in keeping with Canada's long-standing tradition of concern for the displaced and persecuted, our Canadian government facilitate bringing their family members to join them in Canada. Many members of the Syrian Canadian community are concerned that no priority processing or family reunification program is in place to assist their families affected by the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Such measures were taken in 2007 for Iraq; they were taken for Algeria; and they were taken in 2010 for Haiti, after the earthquake. 
He asked this question, and we did as well: why is there no priority program? We were told that the process had been expedited slightly. Yet, I remember that no effort was spared after the earthquake in Haiti. The government created a special program, and everyone worked together to bring people home and reunite families as quickly as possible.
In keeping with our long-standing Canadian tradition, why can we not do the same thing for Syria?
As Faisal Alazem said, it is important to the people of Syria and it is also important to the people living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. The United Nations predicts that by the end of the year, which is just around the corner, there will be 700,000 refugees living in neighbouring countries.
As I was saying earlier, winter has arrived. Some people believe that winter over there is not so bad. This morning it was 3oC in Aleppo. When you live in a house that is not built to Canadian standards, or in a tent, and it is 3oC, that is pretty cold. And life is very difficult with children who are malnourished, frightened and traumatized. 
Yes, we are helping Syria. I was pleased to learn today that we will provide more aid. We were all pleased. However, these efforts must be sustained. We must also work with other countries and encourage them to provide additional aid. This is an urgent matter, and we must not allow this opportunity to save lives to pass us by.",New Democratic Party,Laurier--Sainte-Marie,Hélène Laverdière,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=6fda5a4f-19c6-4cf2-b72d-9a00b48e0d21&Language=E&Section=ALL

Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.)",,Routine Proceedings,Committees of the House,Foreign Affairs and International Development,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a letter that was sent on August 23, 2012 to the ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, CIDA, and Citizenship and Immigration Canada. This was sent from the leader of the Liberal Party and it reads, “Members of the Liberal caucus met this week with representatives of the Syrian-Canadian community”. It encourages them to come up with $2 million in aid. It also says that:
 The Syrian-Canadian community has also expressed the need for additional humanitarian funding to help those on the ground. As the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate, we urge the government to consider implementing a program to match contributions, similar to the program that assists with the humanitarian situation in the Sahel region in West Africa. 
It goes on to ask to expedite immigration as well. I seek unanimous consent to table this letter so that my colleagues across the way might have it.
My question to my colleague is very simple. The government is stepping up and talking about all kinds of things it is doing. I wonder if my colleague would agree or disagree with me that the government should do more, especially in the case of immigration. People in Canada want to sponsor their extended families, parents, grandparents, spouses, and bring them to Canada. Should they be allowed to come to Canada on an expedited basis and given a ministerial permit or visitor visa and have their application continue from here?
Second, does she agree or disagree with me that the government has failed the Syrian Canadian diaspora in matching donations dollar for dollar? The community has advised me that it has raised close to $4 million. I am sure that the representatives who went to committee told the members this, but it went in one ear and out the other.

 Over the past few years, when speaking about the Egyptian revolution or Tunisia or Libya for instance, we have all too often made the mistake of saying that, once the toothpaste is out of the tube, everything is resolved and we do not have to concern ourselves with it anymore. Unfortunately, Canada has been completely absent in the post-revolutionary and post-war periods in these countries, and we see that the situation is not so straightforward.
 It is also urgent that we have a plan for going forward. How are we going to help Syria set up stable, democratic and equitable institutions that respect human rights in every way? If we want the country to attain stability and peace, this is the most crucial thing. Weapons, airplanes and the like are one thing, but genuine security is built on democracy and human rights. This is the only way to guarantee security over the long term.
 We were active in a number of countries, such as Libya. We could have stopped earlier, but we agreed on the first stage, at least. Now, we are no longer there to help the country rebuild, even though we have experience, in terms of federalism for instance, that could be very useful to a number of these countries.

Parliamentary Secretary who will be replying to the question and taking part in the debate today. She is always present and I know that just because the file is a complete disaster does not mean that she will not give a professional, noble answer. I would also like to wish her happy holidays.
On behalf of the NDP, I am pleased to be able to once again raise this important issue, since it has not yet been completely resolved. Indeed, on October 2, 2012, I rose during question period to ask the government two questions.
A few weeks ago already, in the face of mounting evidence gathered by the opposition, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development finally admitted that the former working while on claim pilot project was more beneficial for some unemployed workers than for others. In light of that statement, I asked the minister what she planned to do to resolve the problem now that she was aware of it.
The minister replied, and I quote, “a number of employers across the country are in need of Canadians' skills and abilities. They have jobs to offer people who have these skills and abilities. The problem is that these people are not accepting these jobs or do not know that they exist.” 
But what Canadians learned three days later, late in the afternoon of Friday, October 5, while everyone was heading out for the Thanksgiving long weekend, was that amendments would be made to the famous working while on claim pilot project.
The minister announced:
 Under the adjustment announced today, those EI recipients who were working while on claim between August 7, 2011 and August 4, 2012 will be given the option of reverting to the rules that existed under the previous pilot project. This change will go into effect January 6, 2013, but it will be applied retrospectively to August 5, 2012--the start of the new pilot program. 
 Beginning January 6, 2013, eligible claimants must make the request to revert to the old pilot parameters within 30 days of their last EI benefit payment. For claims that have already ended, claimants will have 30 days from the introduction of this option. 
The Minister's words were clear: these adjustments affected only employment insurance claimants who were working during their benefit period between August 7, 2011 and August 4, 2012.
First, I want to say that it is very admirable that the minister acknowledged that there are flaws in the proposed EI reform. It is natural to try some initiatives and then realize in hindsight that certain amendments are needed. Policy development should be an ongoing improvement process.
However, my concern is that the government offered an inadequate solution to a major problem that was taking money from the pockets of hundreds of thousands of part-time workers who were benefiting from this pilot project. 
The proposed amendments affect too few people in a short period of time. They do not address the problem to solve it once and for all. This seems to be another band-aid measure to placate the public, but the government still has the overall idea of reforming the system to restrict access to EI and reduce benefits.
What does the minister have to say to the pilot project participants who are not eligible to choose between the old and new calculation methods, and what will she have to say to unemployed workers who will work part-time in 2015? When everyone's salary is cut by 50%, will she tell these people that she put off solving the problem and now they are paying the price?",New Democratic Party,Charlesbourg--Haute-Saint-Charles,Anne-Marie Day,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=1a840a29-fe0b-427c-b4f8-7cffd78e9e68&Language=E&Section=ALL

 The employment situation of all Canadians is a matter of great concern for this government.
As the hon. member knows, our country faces ongoing labour and skills shortages. Therefore, it is important that we make changes now to ensure the employment insurance program is working effectively for Canadians. 
The extra five weeks pilot project was always intended as a temporary measure. It was brought in during Canada's economic action plan to help people during the downturn of the recession. The purpose of the EI pilot project is to conduct a test for a defined period, up to three years, in order to accurately assess the labour markets impacts on new approaches that are designed to assist the unemployed. 
The extended EI benefits pilot project was designed as a temporary measure to define and provide an extra five weeks of EI benefits for claimants in 21 regions with higher than average unemployment rates as a result of the economic downturn. 
The pilot project came to its scheduled end on September 15, and even earlier in regions where there was a sustained period of economic recovery whereby the unemployment rate remained below 8% for 12 consecutive months. 
This considered, all EI claimants, including those who are seasonal workers, can still continue to benefit from other recent EI measures introduced by our government. In fact, we are pleased that nearly 900,000 net new jobs have been created since the downturn of the recession, and over 90% of those were full-time. 
We have also introduced, through economic action plan 2012, a new national working while on claim pilot project.
Previously, EI claimants could earn the equivalent of 40%, or $75, of their weekly benefits without seeing a reduction in their benefits. However, if their earnings were above that threshold, their benefits were reduced dollar for dollar. This created a disincentive to accept work beyond the earnings threshold. Under the new working while on claim pilot project that came into effect on August 5, eligible claimants are able to keep EI benefits equalling 50% of every dollar earned while on claim, up to 90% of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate the EI benefits amount. The intent is to encourage claimants to accept all available work while receiving EI benefits and earning some additional income while on claim. 
We know some concerns have been raised about this new pilot project, and we have listened. That is why we recently announced adjustments to the new pilot project.
This will allow individuals to temporarily revert to the rules that existed under the previous pilot project. 
As our government is focused on jobs, growth and long-term prosperity, we are committed to supporting workers and ensuring that EI enables a strong and competitive workforce for all Canadians in every region of the country.",Conservative,Simcoe--Grey,Kellie Leitch,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=3060b2f8-9254-4bba-8c6a-07906e591f1c&Language=E&Section=ALL

It is not the workers who are seasonal, but the work. The workers are prepared to work throughout the year, but the work remains seasonal.
On October 2, I asked a second question in the House. I asked the minister about the fact that unemployment experts were not consulted about changes to the program.
This is even more of a problem now that winter has arrived and Christmas is approaching. Social inequality is growing in Canada. The minister cannot ignore this fact. Thousands of Canadians are having trouble paying their bills, heating their homes and feeding their children.
The economy remains fragile and the unemployment rate is not declining as quickly as the Conservatives had hoped. This means that hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers will find it difficult to make the money last until the end of December, and hundreds if not thousands of these people will be using food banks.
Seasonal work has been most affected. There are jobs in Canada, but the reality is that the jobs are not distributed evenly throughout the year or throughout the regions. We have to live with that, and the minister must take that into account in her reform.
Could the minister listen to everyone who has a stake in employment insurance and announce major adjustments to the reform?",New Democratic Party,Charlesbourg--Haute-Saint-Charles,Anne-Marie Day,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=1a840a29-fe0b-427c-b4f8-7cffd78e9e68&Language=E&Section=ALL

I would like to revisit a question I raised in the House in October 2012, when I said the following:
 Mr. Speaker, the economic recovery is still fragile and, yesterday, instead of announcing tangible solutions to support SMEs, the minister hauled out of mothballs his worn-out promise to reduce red tape, which has not produced any results in six years. 
 Yesterday's announcement certainly cannot be called a recovery plan. It is nothing more than a normal goal for a modern country, and it does not hide the lack of a real vision to help our SMEs and stimulate the country's economy. 
 We are waiting for a real plan for SMEs. What is the minister waiting for to come up with one? 
I would like to revisit this important question. I will now share a few highlights of the response given by the Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. First he congratulated me on my appointment, and I thank him for that. Then he went on to say, “I have been waiting since April to be asked a question about entrepreneurship.”
Let me quickly tell the minister that that is not true, because I had already put questions to him regarding excessive fees for credit cards weeks and months before, but the minister had not bothered answering my questions.
 The minister then said, “For us, entrepreneurship is a priority, not just today but every day.” Again, this is a kind of cynicism that, unfortunately, is very prevalent in this government. It also appropriates economic issues as though not all members of this House were hoping to see the Canadian economy get firmly back on track.
The minister added, “That is why we are reducing the amount of paperwork that governments impose on entrepreneurs.” What a surprise, he used the plural and said “governments”. Why? Is the federal government preparing a plan that will impose standards on the provincial governments? We do not really know, but there is still not even a hint of a plan for small and medium-sized businesses. 
 The next day, my colleague, the industry critic, said, “We want to make things easier for our SMEs, but the the application of random principles like the abolition of a rule before creating another seems much more like improvisation. This is not an economic recovery plan.”
 On the government's website, in a January 2012 document entitled Cutting Red Tape and Freeing Business to Grow, we can read the following under the heading “Message From the Minister of State (Small Business and Tourism)”: “This is why we are proposing to give the Office of the Auditor General of Canada the mandate of reviewing and reporting on the government's progress in reducing regulatory administrative burden through its One-for-One Rule...”. 
Plus one minus one equals zero. We cannot reduce by adding one rule and taking away another. Yet this is the basis for the minister's announcement in the introduction to this document, which has some good points. So we are talking about the Red Tape Reduction Commission that worked on this issue. Why did the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology not study this matter? Why was that mandate given to a committee outside of Parliament?
Some very good people sit on that committee, including Bernard Bélanger, the president and chairman of the board of Premier Tech. There are essential recommendations on Web 3.0. That is very important, because if we integrate Web 3.0 properly, we could at last see small and medium-sized businesses reduce their paperwork. However, we do not really know how this could be achieved.
However, on the website of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, there is an explanation of the administrative reforms. These reforms are broad—and they are referred to as highlights—and so many requests will be made to regulatory bodies, that I am afraid we will have red tape on the red tape related to the process designed to reduce red tape. On the face of it, it really looks like a mess. Therefore, we need answers.
This evening, we have four minutes, and I hope someone on the other side of the House will be able to give us some real answers about how red tape will be reduced.",New Democratic Party,Montmagny--L'Islet--Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup,François Lapointe,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b4cc87d1-2354-4223-9853-43e200a73ce1&Language=E&Section=ALL

Successful entrepreneurs make successful economies, fuelling innovation and productivity gains, and driving job creation and economic growth.
Ensuring an internationally competitive business environment in which entrepreneurs can thrive has been, and will continue to be, a top priority for our government.
Today, Canada is internationally recognized as one of the best places in the world to do business. A solid fiscal standing, with the lowest debt among the leading G7 countries, a competitive tax regime and a robust regulatory system have distinguished Canada at a time when many countries are struggling with rising debt and an increasing tax burden.
Within this solid business infrastructure, the state of entrepreneurship in Canada is relatively strong. However, unnecessary red tape stifles economic growth and job creation. It is a hidden tax that weighs heaviest on the entrepreneurs least able to bear it: small business owners.
If Canada is to maintain its competitive edge, increase productivity and spur innovation, we must constantly strive to improve the conditions for doing business. Thus, we have announced our red tape reduction action plan that promises to further enhance Canada's global reputation.
Most important, our plan responds directly to the needs and concerns entrepreneurs have raised about red tape, saving small businesses both time and money.
The systematic reforms contained in the action plan are game-changers for doing business in Canada and are among the most ambitious of their kind today. Our red tape reduction action plan will cut red tape, make it easier to do business with the federal government and improve service and predictability.
The action plan is a comprehensive response to the Red Tape Reduction Commission's recommendations. The reforms will update the government's regulations and show results through annual reporting.
Principal among the systematic reforms to be implemented over the next three years are the adoption of a one-for-one rule and the application of a small business lens. The one-for-one rule will require regulators to offset new administrative burden costs imposed on business with equal reductions in administrative burden.
Small business owners are at the very heart of Canada's entrepreneurial drive. Yet, because of their more limited resources, small business owners bear a disproportionate burden of red tape.
We are going to change that by introducing a small business lens to regulations. This means that the federal government will be required to assess the impact on small business to demonstrate efforts to keep costs down.
All in all, there is a checklist that regulators will have to fill out and publish. The checklist will drive efforts to minimize burden on small business, avoid duplication and communicate regulatory requirements in clear, plain language.
We are talking about is reducing the time and money small business owners spend filling out forms and reporting information to government. We are trying to find a smarter, less costly way to do business.
Red tape is a costly, hurtful burden on small businesses. Reducing red tape, especially when everyone is looking for ways to keep costs down, is an important thing for government to do. That is what we are doing, so small businesses can do what they do best: innovate, create jobs and grow the economy.",Conservative,Simcoe--Grey,Kellie Leitch,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=3060b2f8-9254-4bba-8c6a-07906e591f1c&Language=E&Section=ALL

Once again, the main idea is “plus one, minus one, equals zero”. It does not mean less. The rest is a vauge intention about how to do it. Reducing red tape is a highly technical endeavour. The government must explain how to achieve that goal. 
The other important thing is that the government cannot do what it is doing and say that reducing red tape qualifies as an economic plan. When we sit down with business people, we talk about fundamental issues, such as specific tax cuts for small businesses and a true job creation tax credit of more than $3,000. Again, I mean a real tax credit, not $1,000 applied to employment insurance. We can talk about making it easier to transfer businesses between members of the same family. Making it easier for small businesses to have access to research and development support would also qualify as an economic recovery plan for small businesses, as opposed to merely reducing red tape, particularly since we still do not really know how small businesses can actually do it.",New Democratic Party,Montmagny--L'Islet--Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup,François Lapointe,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b4cc87d1-2354-4223-9853-43e200a73ce1&Language=E&Section=ALL
