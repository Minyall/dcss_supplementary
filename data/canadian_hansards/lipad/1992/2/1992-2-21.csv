Because of this ineptitude, service to all Canadians is suffering. Its inability to deal fairly with public servants has had a devastating effect on public servant morale. This government has asked the Public Service to do more with less. The reality is that it is doing less with less resources. This must not continue.
As my party's spokesperson for multiculturalism and citizenship, I am particularly, concerned with employment equity. This bill contains a provision on employment equity. Unfortunately it is not enough. It is so vague and discretionary that it will not improve the participation of the four targets groups in the federal
Public Service which is still below acceptable level in spite of the established employment equity policy.
If the Public Service is to be truly reflective of the Canadian population, we must increase the numbers of visible minorities. We must increase the number of women and aboriginal people. We must bring in more people with disabilities.
The Liberal Party believes that all persons are entitled to equal opportunities for entry into the Public Service and will vigorously oppose any attempt to inhibit equality-
Employees must be given assurance that their experience and dedication are valued. Every effort will be made to retrain where necessary to enable them to continue their careers.
The government has failed to achieve in this so-called reform a means of meeting the challenges of the future. We must have public consultations where the interests of the public, of the employees and of the government can be melded into a policy that truly meets the needs of all Canadians.
Using its majority to rush a bill through Parliament is not what Canadians expect of their government. This House should take the time to weigh the consequences of its actions. We are being asked to make a decision that will affect the professional lives of thousands of people. We must have a clear understanding of everything that is at stake here. This cannot be done in a hurry, and that is why we have a duty to postpone this bill, at least for the time being, if we really want to act responsibly in the best interests of those who elected us.

However, on this amendment there are certainly some

February 21, 1992
Government Orders
comments I want to make in response to the statement of the President of the Treasury Board.
He spoke of the process of Public Service 2000, and one of the things he said was that seldom in our history has a program of organizational change been undertaken of the scope and magnitude of Public Service 2000. I agree with him. The scope and magnitude of the impact is on the Public Service, most important on service to the public, on the very effectiveness of this Parliament in making its decisions and having them carried out. They are at stake in this legislation.
I find it therefore reprehensible that the minister, after two years of PS 2000 literally behind closed doors by his own admission, a management driven exercise without the direct involvement of the employees whose lives will be affected, without the direct involvement of the public and without the direct involvement of parliamentarians and after the expenditure of millions of dollars on this exercise, would insist that it be reported back to the House by the end of March. This is the kind of closure on committee that I have seen before during my time in this House. It is the kind of closure that I do not think is conducive to developing and passing good legislation and, more important in this particular case, to a successful revitalization of the Public Service to meet the challenges of the future.
I see also the Minister of Labour in the House. I want to quote from an excellent speech he gave recently called ""Working Families Working Solutions"" to a conference on partnerships for mutual advantage. He made some excellent points in that speech, which make me wish at this time he were the President of Treasury Board or that the President of Treasury Board shared his views.
I am going to quote extensively, because his points are exactly at the root of why the Standing Committee on Public Accounts said this legislation should not come forward until Parliament had an opportunity to review all of PS 2000 and look at what is appropriate legislation.
What he said is that those of us who care about the work place need to be innovative and caring. ""The history of the last 15 to 20 years shows that countries best able to contend with economic change are those that have a tradition and commitment to strong labour management partnerships"".
I underline ""partnerships"" because the bill before us is a contradiction of everything that has to do with labour-management partnerships. It is a refutation of that very principle, and it is a denial of the promise that the previous President of Treasury Board made that no legislation would come forward except what was mutually agreed to. What we have here is a bill that is 90 per cent, at least, not acceptable to those who represent the employees of the Government of Canada.
I am going to quote further from the minister. He said: ""In Canada's most important industries, unions and companies are co-operating on issues of mutual concern. I believe the labour minister is entirely in tune with what is necessary to improve labour management relationships in this country, to ensure that we have a work force that is adaptable to change and prepared for the future"". The minister knows-and I wish the President of Treasury Board knew it-there are companies in this world where union representatives sit on the board of directors of corporations so that they share mutually in the problems and prospects for the company.
The minister spoke at the same time about the Labour-Management Partnership Program. This is a $1.4 million program that has been put in place to assist unions and employees to work together on initiatives. He has talked about this program as promoting productive, fair work places.
""The commitment of Canadians"", and I am still quoting from the Minister of Labour, ""to joint action will be a major determinant of the extent to which we are successful in the world economy"". I do hope the President of the Treasury Board is listening. ""We Canadians"", again quoting the Minister of Labour, ""are only beginning to see what joint action on the part of labour and management can yield for us. By coming together we can achieve enormously for our workers and for Canadian society as a whole"".
That should be the purpose, that should have been the process of PS 2000. In indicating an unreasonably tight time line, less than three weeks, for a legislative committee to report back to this House, the minister asked for non-partisan and constructive co-operation. The minister knows that from the time he took over his portfolio he had the offer of that co-operation on this dossier from me. I think he knows that the offer was genuine. It
February 21, 1992

was based on the public accounts committee's recommendations that it was absolutely essential to have a special parliamentary committee that could hear all parties, that could consider the public interest, that could consider the views of the employees as well as those of management. Unfortunately the actions of the minister since then and of the government have made that impossible. We have a huge bill here.
The last time the Public Service Employment Act and the Public Service Staff Relations Act were brought into this House, it was the result of total process of co-operation, consultation that involved parliamentarians, that involved the public, that involved employees and that involved managers. But they are only one part of the solution to the problems that confront the Public Service today.
There were 118 amendments brought forward in spite of all that long period of consultation because that bill was then and is now dealing with some fundamental issues of vital importance to this country. I tell the minister that offer of co-operation and non-partisanship is still open to him. He only has to do, as has been recommended by the public accounts committee, as has been proposed by this party in this House, set up that committee of parliamentarians. Let us have a thorough review of this bill, bring back to this House legislation that is acceptable to all parties and that can be passed overnight.
This party and this member will not co-operate on a blanket permission to contract out without any process of accountability and without any policy on contracting out. This party and this member will not co-operate on a bill that leaves everything to be done by regulation following the passage of the bill. This party will not co-operate on the undermining of the merit principle which has been at the root of the Public Service of Canada for over 70 years. This party will not co-operate on departing from equity and fairness in employment and promotion in the Public Service nor on accountability to Parliament and accountability to the public for how its human and financial resources are being used.
We will not co-operate on the right of employees to a fair hearing when they feel their rights have been abused and their opportunities in the Public Service jeopardized. We will not co-operate, above all, on the diminution of
Government Orders
service to the public because that is what our Public Service is all about.
We will not co-operate on the politicization of the Public Service and that is what this bill is all about.
This is an important bill. It deserves the attention of parliamentarians. It deserves the attention of a legislative committee that will have ample opportunity to hear views, to consider and to do what Canadians do so well to accommodate, to listen to one another, to balance the various interests and to come up with a bill that will serve Canadians and Parliament well for the next decade and into the next century.

I gave notice at that time that I wanted to speak on the amendment by my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier.
What the amendment is asking for is that the bill be withdrawn and the subject matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
I know it is not always protocol to say who is here and who is not, but I want to make mention of how very pleased I am that the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Labour are both here to listen to and to take part in these debates.
I sat on the committee which studied the Finkelman report in 1976. At that time, we proceeded with great deliberation with the recommendations that were brought forward at the time.
My colleague from Ottawa-Vanier and I spent many hours listening to the witnesses who appeared before the committee. We did bring out very strong recommendations. In all modesty, I believe they were of service not only to our public servants but also to all the people of Canada.
I want to put on record as the critic for labour that the Liberal Party views our public servants as very hardworking and dedicated people.
We malign ourselves as a nation when we say that the people who are administering the programs which we legislate here in Parliament are not doing their work, or when we give any indication that their work is not acceptable. In doing a disservice to them, we do a disservice to ourselves.

Government Orders
I spoke the last time of the Liberal Party view of the Public Service. Today I want to address the merit principle per se.
Our party supports the merit principle. We will oppose the government's efforts to reintroduce what we believe is patronage and favouritism in the Public Service.
I will just set this all in perspective once again. In 1919, the Civil Service Commission, now the Public Service Commission, was established to safeguard the principle that the best qualified person would be selected for appointment, promotion and transfer in the Public Service.
This ideal has not changed. This objective has not changed. We in the Liberal Party intend to pursue this as our goal. This principle was established to stop the rampant political and administrative patronage and to ensure Canadians had a non-partisan Public Service where employment and opportunities were open to all based on competence, not favouritism.
It was not unknown even as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, not necessarily in our Public Service but in some public services in the provinces, that when a government changed, the bureaucrats were changed almost wholesale right across the province. That was not fair.
That was rampant, political patronage and we must not have that happen again here with our public servants.
Incidentally, this principle contributed to the protection of employee rights to fair treatment based on ability by establishing appeal procedures. We set up a system whereby if the employee believed that he was not being treated fairly then he did have an appeal procedure which would guarantee fairness.
As well, it ensures that government services are delivered to all Canadians without political favouritism. Sadly, I have heard it said that some people are more equal than others when it comes to dealing with public servants.
I do not believe this. I do not hold this to be true, but if we are going to continue with a principle that we established, then I suggest to you we not only have to
have the procedures set in place but we have to work in a spirit of mutual trust.
This legislation, in my opinion, seriously undermines the merit principle. It leaves all but original hiring and limited promotions to the discretion of managers, while opening the door to patronage and favouritism and punitive measures based on a manager's personal likes or dislikes, or to the whims of the government of the day.
I am not only talking about this government that is in place now, but also about future governments.
What we are trying to do is to enact legislation which will be fair not only for today but also for all the tomorrows to come so that our civil servants can be treated fairly.
The ability of the Public Service Commission to be the watch-dog of the public interest is very severely curtailed if it feels it is in any way being hampered.
I want to turn now to employment equity as opposed to just equity in general.
Bill C-26 contains a provision on employment equity that is very vague. In fact, it is so vague and discretionary as to be almost meaningless.
Surely the ministers and the members here will admit that this particular provision requires no accountability. Without accountability, I maintain that the bill is flawed.
We support a strong provision in the legislation committing the Public Service to employment equity and to accountability for treating all applicants and employees equally on merit.
We believe that all persons are entitled to equal opportunities to enter and progress in the Public Service.
I and my colleagues will oppose measures that inhibit equality.
The lack of equity in opportunities for employment and advancement in the Public Service is well documented.
There was a report called Beneath the Veneer. This was a report of the Thsk Force on Barriers to the Employment and Promotion of Women in the Public Service. It is the most recent documentation that attitudes are the main barrier to equality of opportunity.

These attitudes, often unconscious, keep women, visible minorities, persons with disabilities, and aboriginal Canadians lumped in the lower echelons of the Public Service.
Surely we have progressed enough in this day and age that we know that all Canadians are equal under the Constitution. This is our birthright. This belongs to all of us, simply by the fact that we are Canadian citizens.
We must not allow legislation to go through which could in any way be interpreted as somehow disfavouring our visible minorities or weakening our positive attitudes towards women, aboriginal people, and people with either physical or mental disabilities.
The merit principle is not operating equally for these target groups. If selection for promotion were based only on ability I maintain that these groups would be represented at all levels, at least proportionally to the representation in the Public Service.
I maintain from all of the data I have been able to study that they are not. I have some examples to fortify my point.
The first example concerns contracting out, privatization, and this new word that we have, downsizing. That is another word for firing people or letting them go. The use of short-term employees and personnel service contracts have all made it more difficult to correct the inequities of the past. New managerial discretion means the same attitudes identified in the report ""Beneath the Veneer"" will be unchanged in any way. Thrget groups fear, and I believe rightly so, that favouritism based on outdated images of who is competent and who is not competent will prevail without looking into the background of these people to see what their true abilities are.
Another aside about this type of treatment is, I believe, that potential for harassment, mental harassment and, yes, even sexual harassment is increased when managers have increased control over one's employment opportunities. If you do not please a manager, in effect what you are doing is excluding your chances to advance in the Public Service.
I conclude with this statement. I agree with my colleague, the member for Ottawa-Vanier, who I be-
Govemment Orders
lieve will be chairing this committee. I hope he is chairing the committee so that we can have an impartial person looking into the different processes and the legislation which is proposed.
We are committed to stability and fair treatment in the Public Service of all of the employees. I speak for my party, as the labour critic, when I say we will oppose measures that reduce the commitment to train and continue the employment of those affected by these changing requirements.

As you know, Madam Speaker, he has risen in this House and spoken in this debate a few times now. I recall that on the first day of debate on second reading, he indicated his desire to speak for longer than the allotted time, which I think was 20 minutes, and of course the House denied him the unanimous consent to continue, notwithstanding his great knowledge of matters relating to the Public Service, for reasons that I simply cannot fathom.
Now we have the government squawking that this debate is going on too long and yet it denied the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, who knows more about the Public Service than the minister, the opportunity to participate and give the House the benefit of his views, which I may say are much more in accord with the wishes of the public in Canada and the Public Service in particular than are the views of the government and the minister as expressed in this silly bill.
The sad thing is this bill is designed to take away the rights of public servants. That is why we have been objecting to this. The government is unilaterally changing the work conditions for public servants. I must say that from all the indications I have, and I am not an expert in the matter of procedure in dealing with bills of this kind, this method is quite unprecedented.
The minister says he can see that. Of course, I would defer to his authority if he would defer to the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier and agree with his approach to things. The member for Ottawa-Vanier has been here longer than both the minister and I and knows

February 21, 1992
Government Orders
a great deal more about this than either of us do, I suggest to the minister.
I was hoping that the minister would follow past practice, which has been to send the matters for study to a committee in advance and then have a bill come to the House on matters relating to the Public Service. It is quite unprecedented for the government to act unilaterally in a bulldozing way to force its will on the Public Service of Canada as it is doing by Bill C-26.
As I indicated in my earlier speech, which again was cut off because of this new 10-minute rule, I said that this bill was an unfair attack for various reasons. One of the reasons that I did not get to expand on properly and that I would like to explain is that of a rule that allows for the government to proceed with contracting out. We all know that there is no restriction on the government's ability to contract out. However, public servants objected to the fact that they were laid off after contracting out ""because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function"". The act currently allows for public servants to be laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function.
The Public Service Staff Relations Board in March 1990 ruled that the government could not contract out services and then lay off public servants because of a lack of work. Obviously there was no lack of work. It simply ended the opportunity to do the work by public servants by the contracting out. The government thought this was a dreadful decision from the Public Service Staff Relations Board and appealed it to the Federal Court.
Mr. Justice Mahoney, a distinguished and capable judge of great experience on the bench, heard the appeal and gave a decision for the majority of the court. He said: ""It cannot, in my view, be said that the services of an employee whose job has been contracted out are not required because of lack of work or the discontinuance of a function. That employee is not required only because the job has been contracted out. The work remains to be done and the function continues"".
It makes perfect sense. That is what the learned judge said in his decision. The government did not like that. The government was wrong. It did not like being told it was wrong by the Public Service Staff Relations Board and by the Federal Court and so it brought in this bill.
Clause 19 of the bill gives the government the power to lay off following contracting out. In other words, it can say to public servants: ""We think the job you are doing costs us too much. We would rather give it to some of our fat cat Tory friends. We will make a contract with the fat cat Tories and then lay you off and let somebody else make the money"".
The minister wags his head. He knows that what I am saying is correct. He is laughing at the plight of the Public Service that he is mistreating by this bill.
The second aspect of the bill that I want to talk about is clause 22 which gives deputy heads of departments the right to deploy staff, that is to shift members of staff around within the deputy head's jurisdiction without any competition.
Deployment, as used in this sense, is simply another word for transfer. Under the present act, transfers are considered staffing actions and are subject to the merit principle and therefore may be appealed. In other words, the best person for the job has to be found within the limits of the class that is allowed to apply and then is transferred to the position, but that apparently is no longer the case. Now we are simply taking away the right of public servants to compete for these transfers. The decision will rest only with the deputy head.
The administrative practice of many, many years, I cannot tell you how far back this goes and perhaps the minister could enlighten us in a speech that he might make on this, but I am sure this practice has existed in the Public Service for easily 30 to 40 years. Now it is being changed so that there is no further right of appeal if a public servant is not transferred to a position that he or she wishes to seek.
The Public Service Commission implemented an exclusion approval order removing the right of appeal on any movement of an individual from one position to another identical classification group and level. This order was challenged and last month the Federal Court of Canada struck it down because the order ""departs substantially from the merit principle"". In other words, the merit principle, which has been the highlight and the test for transfer and promotion in the Public Service, is being abandoned by the government in this bill. Why? Political convenience, what else?
February 21, 1992

Why would the government seek to take away from Canadians the right to expect that the best person will be appointed for the job? Because it wants to put its own friends in the job, that is why. This is an abuse of the Canadian Public Service which has been the envy of many other countries because of its independence and its impartiality in terms of political matters. The government by this bill is seeking, in my submission, to politicize Canada's Public Service and it is entirely, entirely inappropriate.
The next change that I think is of great significance is the change in the Financial Administration Act. Clause 81 of the bill gives jurisdiction over termination and demotion of employees. It transfers this out of the Public Service Act and out of the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and gives it to the Treasury Board. That has to be one of the strangest things going. Why would you have an independent body which was an adjudicative body dealing with termination and demotion cases suddenly lose its jurisdiction and have the employer, through the Treasury Board, exercise that jurisdiction?
In other words, if your employer fires you, you appeal to the Treasury Board, which is your employer's board for redress. Why is the independent body being deprived of its ability to make those adjudications? Did the government not like the decisions of the Public Service Commission? Was that the problem? One would suspect so. It appoints the members to it. What happened? Did it not get the right people?
I cannot understand this. It is inconceivable that any other employer would take unto itself the right to hear the appeals, particularly where the employer is a political body, such as the Government of Canada and should be accountable through a much more independent mechanism in its dealings with its public servants. That is what we have had in this country for many, many years, I think since about World War 1.1 may be wrong, but the Public Service Commission is not a new institution in Canada and now the government is undermining its authority in this very important respect.
I see that my time has expired. For all these reasons I urge the House to agree to the amendment proposed by
Government Orders
the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier and scupper this bill at second reading.

Duhamel (St. Boniface):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Madam Speaker, I am pleased to address this particular piece of legislation once again. I have indicated previously and I want to stress again that I consider this an attack on the Public Service.
One might ask why this would be occurring at this particular time. Well, Madam Speaker, you and I both know that the civil service is a handy target. Some people talk about their large salaries, their generous benefits and what have you.
One of the things I find surprising is that people put the blame on the civil servants as opposed to those who have granted those benefits. We all know they have unions that represent them and sit down with government to bargain. It is governments that say yes or no. Therefore, why do the civil servants become the targets?
Obviously in a climate such as exists right now where there is a lot of apprehension, anxiety and concern about one's job today, tomorrow and in the future, they become easy, handy targets and I am really concerned about this. I am concerned about the myths that we allowed to speak about the lack of excellence. It is an excellent civil service, yet we propagate these kinds of myths. I find this unfortunate because I find it extremely divisive.
Some countries undertake military or bold action in order to make themselves more popular in the polls when they are suffering electorally. In this particular case, the government has targeted a number of groups. One of them, I maintain, is the civil service. I really find this very, very unfortunate.
Let us look at the purpose of this particular bill. On paper it looks very good. What we want to do is attempt to deal with a changing situation. Obviously we cannot manage and govern as we did a number of years ago. Obviously we need to change the rules and regulations. Obviously we need to find that right balance between permitting the managers to undertake a number of decisions within their discretion. At the same time we need to protect employees and the rights they have acquired overtime.

February 21, 1992
Government Orders

We need that balance between managers and employees who have acquired certain rights through years of collective bargaining, and I think the two can be combined without denying employees their rights. It would be unfortunate if we were to do that.

As you know, this particular piece of legislation will permit people to hire, fire and transfer employees without the normal protections they now have. The merit principle is in jeopardy. There will be contracting out. I find it interesting that the government claims that contracting out saves money. When I asked on the Order Paper for a record of everything that had been contracted out, I was told that under a certain figure, the figures are not available. Why? What in the world are we trying to hide?
If you are really saving money, you ought to be proud, government, to show it in black and white. Of course the suspicion is that there is no money being saved. These are simply ways in order to permit those who are friendly to government to profit from government. Until I receive a clear, precise answer to the question I have raised, I shall continue to doubt the government's intentions in this particular matter.
I believe I could find a great deal of support for my feeling that there has been inadequate consultation with a number of people. The government will cite the meetings, but ask the employees whether or not they feel comfortable. Ask the employees whether or not there needs to be additional discussions. There does need to be additional discussions. This is major legislation that will affect services throughout Canada.

Another example of a government that is undermining the very foundations of this country is that it has launched attacks on VIA Rail, Air Canada, Canada Post-all institutions that bound this country together, that made it strong and far more united than it is today. And it continues to attack one institution after another in order to destroy this country. The government may not be doing this on purpose, but the result is the same.

The government priorities are privatization, contracting out, the use of short-term employees. I have yet to see proof that this is going to be helpful to us, that this is going to be helpful to Canadians in general and that this is going to improve the climate, the morale in the Public Service, that this will get better performance out of men and women who have committed a major part of their lives to Canada and to serving Canadians.

I ask the government to reconsider this bill and to give serious consideration to the amendments that have been proposed, so that when they proceed with the bill, they are absolutely sure they are doing something that will be good for all Canadians across this country.
I sincerely hope they will reflect on the recommendations they have received and on the advice they have just been given, because I believe that if this government decides to take our advice, Canadians across this country will benefit. However, we Canadians throughout the country will pay for it if they go ahead without the necessary consultation, without protecting the merit principle, without ensuring that this bill does exactly what it should do, namely to strike a fair balance between the rights of supervisors and managers and those of the employees who serve Canadians.
That concludes what I wanted to say this morning.

We are privileged to have the President of the Treasury Board here with us this morning. He knows the public service well because he was part of it before he entered politics. He distinguished himself in the public service as a civil servant and as a diplomat. So I am sure that he understands this whole issue very well and is sensitive to it.
I would like to deal with this question not from a technical angle but from a practical one. Madam Speaker, you, like me and all our colleagues, probably meet public servants often. One of the most common complaints is that public servants feel that they have to know someone in the system in order to get ahead. This bill confirms that attitude.
February 21, 1992

That is why I support the amendment moved by my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier. What he is really asking us to do is to set this bill aside and refer the whole matter to the Public Accounts Committee. This committee does outstanding work and I think that it is one of the few committees that is non-partisan and works in a non-partisan way. We should look at the bill objectively and come back with something that could really put some order in the public service. That is very important for our country, so that Canadians can have the services to which they are entitled and which they need. At the same time those who work in that system can feel that they can advance on the basis of merit if they are competent.
I think that the amendment of my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier is reasonable. I would hope that the government and the President of the Treasury Board, who is here in the House, would decide to act along the lines of the kind of parliamentary reform we would like to see and let members consider this matter in committee.
If people feel cynical about Parliament today, they are right. The government is forcing a bill on us. We have no choice in the matter. The only choice we have is to vote for or against the bill. I think it would be a step toward parliamentary reform if the public accounts committee, which has members from all sides of the House, from all recognized political parties, could consider this bill and come back with legislation on Public Service reform that we as Canadians, as the government of this country and as Parliament, could accept as being fair and equitable to all members of our Public Service.

I thought that I should take advantage of this opportunity to participate for a few moments and to put a few thoughts on the record.
This bill was, as you know, Madam Speaker, tabled first back in June 1991 so it has been before the House for quite some time now, before the House in the sense that it has been available to members and to the people

in the Public Service. The public has had an opportunity to look at the bill and to express its concerns about it and to make sure that the issue had a profile within the country. Of course, that is something that is extremely crucial in a democracy such as we have.
The bill before us is important. It is a bill that has been discussed in terms of its preparation for a long time. It has received a great deal of consultation and a great deal of input from a number of different people. As a result, I think the bill before us will receive certainly the majority support of this House, and considerable support across the country.
What I have found particularly intriguing is that as I have watched the process unfold, I have watched my good friend from Vanier, who is a very capable and competent individual and also a very skilled parliamentarian, on two separate occasions move amendments to the bill that, although they are couched in very nice language, have essentially had exactly the same impact. That impact has been to derail the bill, to destroy the bill, to prevent the bill from making any progress here in the House of Commons.

I am proud to say that he was bom in Toronto in the closing years of the last century, 1898, and was soon recognized as one of this country's great talents by the members of the Group of Seven who admitted him to their ranks in 1926.
From his colleagues, notably Lawren Harris, he developed a style based on simplification and the elimination of non-essentials.
He went on to contribute even more than his paintings by giving his full support to environmental causes.
Joining the ranks of the Order of Canada as an officer in 1978, he exposed this country to us in ways that did credit to all other members of that order and to the country itself.
There are those individuals who are given the talent to contribute something special to society. A. J. Casson was such a Canadian. Fortunately many of his works remain preserved in the public.

This project involves investments totaling more than $35 million and will create and consolidate more than 400 high-tech jobs.
In conclusion, this assistance program is an excellent way to give a new impetus to research establishments so that they in turn can contribute to economic development-

They are important for producers because our system of supply management is good for them. They know how much product they are going to be able to produce and dispose of. They know that they will get the reasonable price that they have negotiated. It is good for them.
It is good for the people working in the processing industry. As long as we are producing our own product those processing plants will have an opportunity to dispose of the small surplus that is calculated to satisfy just the process market.
It is good for communities in many parts of Canada where they are totally dependent upon the agricultural input into those communities.
It is good for Canada as a whole. It is a system unique to Canada, better than anything else anywhere in the world to produce the required amount of product.
The government has an opportunity and a responsibility to stand up not just for producers, not just for consumers, but for the whole of Canada and to say: ""We are a sovereign nation. We will do this because it is good for Canada. We want you to work with us, but we are going to do it"".

In fact the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency was established as late as 1986.
It is clear that the existing article XI of GATT is inadequate.
Therefore, with the support of Canadian dairy, egg and poultry producers, Canada has sought as part of its negotiating strategy at the current GATT round a strengthened article XI which would guarantee the import quota protection that is required by the supply managed sectors.
The problem is that the Canadian position on the import quotas has been declared unacceptable by all but a tiny handful of other countries.
I hope the delegation of farm leaders presently in Europe will be able to make the European Community better understand the Canadian position.
This calls for substantial reductions to all trade-distorting subsidies, increased access to international markets, a strengthened article XI, and clearer trade rules that equally apply to all nations.

It can do so without need of taxpayers' money. It is simply a matter of regulatory changes both in terms of licensing of pilots and in terms of creating a recreational category of aeroplanes.
The argument I face in pushing this industry is that we must as Canadians wait for other countries to develop regulations that would be consistent with ours, thus providing us with a market.

For example, I am sure the member would be interested in knowing that with 9 per cent inflation-and that was the average rate of inflation between 1974 and 1984-a person on a pension or on a fixed income would see his or her income cut in half in just eight years.

Some say: ""Why does he not meet people personally?"" He is going to meet the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr. Andreotti. He is going to meet Mr. Bush. He has talked to Mr. Major.
