O. 31,PENSIONS,,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituents in Beaver River and all Canadians to demand that the Conservative government immediately rescind the disgraceful scheme that gives members of Parliament and senators access to the most generous pension plan in the country.
From the outset the Reform Party has opposed this excessive plan that allows any member, no matter the age, to receive at least $23,390 a year after just six years in this Chamber. No Canadian citizen, no private sector worker, receives anywhere near the equivalent pension benefit. This must be stopped.
The Conservatives have failed to bring the deficit under control. The government must find the courage to reduce spending, starting with cuts to our own pensions. This is an outrage to ordinary Canadians whose tax bill has increased year after year under the Conservatives.
I realize, Mr. Speaker, that the government has a vested interest in maintaining these pensions because many of its members may be replaced, in fact by Reformers in the next election. Nonetheless this offensive pension scheme must be stopped and stopped now.

It was on February 7, 1792 that Sir Alured Clarke, Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada, launched his now famous proclamation on behalf of the King of England, addressed to all those wishing to settle on Crown lands in the Province of Lower Canada. This proclamation granted concessions and letters patent to thousands of Loyalist settlers from the United States.
This led to the founding of a number of townships named Brome, Sutton, Famham, Bolton, Potton, Stan-bridge, Magog, and so forth, names that still designate a number of municipalities in my riding, which together form what we call the Eastern Townships.

In 1985, under the leadership of Senator Muriel McQueen Fergusson, a charitable trust foundation was established in Fredericton to fund research into the causes, incidences and forms of treatment of family violence, and to promote and sponsor effective public education programs to counter widespread ignorance of the problem.
Over the past two years, working with the University of New Brunswick, the Fergusson Foundation is well advanced toward the creation of a national research centre for the study of family violence. It will be located within the Faculty of Arts at UNB. The purpose of its activities will be to increase our knowledge of the social and psychological dynamics which contribute to family violence.
This initiative leads and complements the government's plan to establish such research centres on family violence right across Canada. Hopefully the leadership of the Fergusson Foundation will be recognized by the selection of UNB as one of those national centres.

Likewise, Montrealers who have requested the forms in the French version must return again when the choice is available, possibly next week. The situation is ridiculous.

It has clawed back the old age pension, increased board and lodging charges to veterans in long-term care and cut back on the Veterans Independence Program.
The government has recently asked all departments to come up with cost cutting ideas. The Minister of Finance and President of the Treasury Board have indicated that some social programs may be cut. Some Conservative MPs have openly called for the end of our universal health care system. The federal Conservatives sound like the Reform Party, which wants to cut all government departments by 15 per cent.
Even as the government develops a long-range plan for Veterans Affairs, the department is reducing staff and centralizing the war veterans allowance program in Charlottetown. Some operations of the DVA will soon be taken over by Health and Welfare Canada.
The Minister of Veterans Affairs must answer two questions: Is the government considering the amalgamation of veterans affairs operations with one or more other departments and is the government considering making the war veterans allowance, disability pension and other DVA benefits taxable?

One member says no, and I understand why. I can understand that there are other things that people are not discussing. That includes pooling, MCRs, and further activity in enhancing our system of handling in the west. The talks are ongoing.
The member asks a question that is based on something that may not happen, that may not be a route that would be taken by the government or the producers particularly. I think it is inappropriate to attempt to answer it.

All of that being said, we take this problem very seriously. We have always, always taken this problem very seriously. I will examine the issue with the provinces of whether it is not necessary to regulate and, if we come to the conclusion that is what we need, that is what we will do.

I think the hon. member will acknowledge that almost all members in this House have taken very seriously the processes we have put forward. We have very actively sought to include as many people as possible in this process, including the aboriginal communities. In fact we put forward a proposal by which they could participate in some conferences, but I regret to report that only two of the aboriginal communities reported that they were favourable to that. In those circumstances we did not think it was appropriate to go forward.
That being the case, we are still ready to look at any mechanisms that will ensure aboriginal people, as all segments of Canadian society, have their say in this very important debate about the future of our country.

In previous conferences there were no provisions for aboriginal people. They in fact hijacked the process to get input. There was unanimous consent by the organizations to have a conference on aboriginal affairs.
Having said that, I have in my possession letters from the national organization leaders who would like to have designated the fifth and final conference as an aboriginal conference on aboriginal constitutional agenda.
Will the government reconsider its position and have that conference designated as an aboriginal conference, or will it deny the will of the public again?

The committee at that time made certain recommendations to the House and to the government relating to an apology, compensation and recognition of the contribution of the Inuit people who had been transferred from northern Quebec to the community of Grise Fiord up in the High Arctic.
Under Standing Order 109, the committee then called for a response by the government within the prescribed 150 days. As the Speaker will recall, in response to the committee report on November 19, 1990, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs tabled what he called The Hickling report which contained the government's response to our committee's recommendation. It totally supported the government's position, no apology, no recognition, no compensation.
February 5, 1992

My problem is in the way the minister described the The Hickling report and its consultant in tabling the report. First, he called the consultant independent and in fact the consultant who did the study, Bud Neville, was a former employee of the Department of Indian and North Affairs between 1957 and 1971, slightly after the time that the relocations took place. The person who did the report was anything but independent.
In addition, he called the consultants themselves, the Hickling consultancy, independent whereas in fact that group had received, according to questions we had answered in the House, over $20 million in government funding.

I would like to advise all hon. members that I am now ready to rule on a question of privilege raised on Monday, February 3, by the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River concerning the failure of the Minister of Finance to table an Order in Council pursuant to section 59(5) of the Customs Tariff. The Chair has reviewed this serious issue and thanks the hon. member for his succinct explanation of the case.

As I said during the statement, I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt for their interventions.

In his presentation, the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River correctly pointed out that the Customs Tariff required that an Order in Council respecting the elimination of tariffs on certain plywood and related products under the free trade agreement be tabled in the House of Commons by the Minister of Finance on April 21, 1989 at the latest. This Order in Council was finally tabled on December 12, 1991, some 32 months later. The hon. member did note, however, that this document was registered and published in the Canada Gazette of January 18, 1989, thus being placed in the public domain. He also stated that he was confident that the minister's failure to comply with the law was not intentional. The basis of his complaint was that the non-observance of a legal obligation established for the collective benefit of members of the House amounts to a

February 5, 1992
Speaker's Ruling
contempt of the House. Summarizing his argument the hon. member asked:
In short, does the omission to table a document legally required to be tabled impede or obstruct the House and its members in the discharge of their functions, or does it have the tendency to do so?
This is the question directed to the Chair. [Translation]
The first point that the Chair wishes to highlight is that Speakers do not interpret or enforce matters of statutory law. There are many precedents to this effect.
On June 19, 1978, a question of privilege was raised respecting the late tabling of the Postmaster General's annual report. In rejecting claims that the failure to respect the law constituted a breach of privilege, Speaker Jerome warned the House that the authority of the Chair did not extend to the determination of questions of law.

On two occasions-March 27, 1981 and February 10, 1983-Speaker Sauve confirmed this principle in denying claims for the Chair to intervene in cases similar to the one raised by the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River. In each of these situations, the government had failed to live up to its statutory responsibility to table documents within a specific period of time. In response, Madam Speaker ruled that the Chair had neither the responsibility to interpret the law nor the authority to compel the government to obey it.
These precedents served to highlight the restrictive nature of the Chair's authority with respect to legal questions. However, while the matter raised on Monday may stem from a statutory requirement, the main thrust of the issue is not of a legal nature, but rather a procedural one. As the hon. member for Scarborough- Rouge River so aptly stated, ""This is a question of fact rather than a question of law"". In the manner of his presentation, the situation is different from earlier cases.
Another key element raised by the hon. member relates to the failure of government officials to act on demands for the tabling of this Order in Council. As he explained in his submission:
It is far too common for public servants to treat tabling requirements as a matter of little or no consequence with the result that over the years, members of this House have repeatedly had to raise the issue of non-compliance with such requirements. The failure of the minister's officials to advise him of his obligations is all the more inexcusable in this case in that the non-tabling of the order was drawn to the attention of an assistant deputy minister in the minister's department in a letter from one of the counsel to the joint committee for the scrutiny of regulations dated May 8, 1989. Officials of the same department were reminded of this on subsequent occasions prior to December 12,1991.
That is all a quote from the hon. member but I think it very clearly puts his case.
Therefore, in light of the notices given to the department and its failure to comply with the letter of the law, the hon. member claims that a contempt of the House has occurred and that this case should be dealt with as an offence against the authority and dignity of the House.

The Chair wishes to address some other remarks of the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River. The member stated that the purpose of tabling documents in the House ""is to require documents to be laid before it in circumstances where it determines that the formal transmission of a document is necessary for members of Parliament to properly discharge their responsibility of holding the executive accountable for its actions"". Tabling either by the front door or the back door, whether at the discretion of a minister or because of a legal requirement, is an action of the House and as such it is recorded in the Votes and Proceedings, the official record of the decisions of the House.
It is through tabling that members are officially apprised of the existence of a document. Thus when we include in legislation provisions for tabling, it is not done lightly but is done for a serious purpose.

The tabling of documents, as specified in our rules, is one of the procedures on which hinges the ability of members to discharge their functions. In particular, with the reform of the rules in 1982, all reports, returns and papers to be laid before the House in accordance with the requirements of the statute are automatically referred to a standing committee pursuant to Standing Order 32(5). Thus, a failure to table any required document has the effect of impeding such committees

from carrying out their mandate ""to examine and inquire into all such matters as may be referred to them by the House"" as stipulated by Standing Order 108(1).
Our capacity as elected representatives is to be ever vigilant and to protect the interests of our electors. The statutory laws which are in force, those which have been adopted by Parliament as a whole, are meant to be respected and serve no purpose if they are ignored. To quote the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River, ""a right which cannot be enforced is no right at all"". The fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether the Standing Committee on External Affairs and International Trade has been interfered with because it had to wait 32 months before being formally seized of the Order in Council.
The Chair has reflected seriously upon this matter. I have examined very carefully the circumstances surrounding this particular case and the argument presented by the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River. I note that the hon. member stated that the correspondence in question has been between counsel for the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations and officials from the Department of Finance. It appears that the matter relating to the punctual tabling of these types of Orders in Council lies more appropriately with the committee, at least at the present time. If the committee senses that a contempt has occurred it is within its power to report this fact to the House. Once the House is in receipt of such a report, it can take appropriate action.

Until the Committee has reported on this matter, it could be argued that the House should not be dealing with the particular circumstances of this case. It may be that the Committee is in the process of taking some action or that it is contemplating doing so in the future.
In the view of the Chair, this would be an appropriate way of dealing with this matter for the moment, since the committee has already initiated work in this area and may want to continue its review of this matter. As a result of its work, the Committee may want to report to the House recommending an action for the House to
Speaker's Ruling
take or it might want to report on what it sees as a contempt, at which time the matter may once again come before the House. Without the benefit of the committee's view on this whole matter, I am reluctant to rule that prima facie a contempt of the House exists at this time.

I wish to add however a cautionary comment. Since 1985 Standing Order 32(5) was amended to read as follows:
Reports, returns or other papers laid before the House in accordance with an act of Parliament shall thereupon be deemed to have been permanently referred to the appropriate standing committee.
I have to say-I think I probably speak for the House-those responsible to meet any deadlines for the tabling of documents in the House of Commons provided for in the Statutes of Canada should reflect carefully about the possible consequences of any delay. I thank hon. members for their assistance in this matter.

Am I to understand that when there is an obligation on the part of the member of this House to table a document and there is a breach of that obligation which affects the rights and privileges of all members of Parliament, not just members of Parliament from one particular party, that amounts to a non-compliance by the minister in question?
My question for the Speaker is if these elements have been answered in the affirmative-yes, there was an obligation; yes, there was a breach; yes, the privileges of the member have been breached because he was not able to get the document-that would seem to me to be

The hon. member for Cape Breton-East Richmond also makes a very cogent argument. Perhaps he would have been happy to make that argument a few days earlier.
Whether the hon. member did or not, if the hon. member considers carefully what the Chair said, I think it would be very unwise for anyone to take from the judgment that I have just given that the deliberate refusal to file documents that are to be filed under statute law to committee or to this House would necessarily be treated as not a contempt of the House. If one looks also very carefully at what the Chair has said, I think I have made it clear that I would be prepared to hear further from the committee in question.

In terms of the tabling of documents, they were deemed to have been referred to the Standing Joint Committee on the Government of Canada's Proposals for a Renewed Canada. I presuppose that after the tabling of those documents there will be the appropriate indexing of those documents so that if constituents or others wish to find out in fact where their documents have been, they will be cross-referenced appropriately under the joint standing committee. Is that correct?
Mr. Coopen Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising that point because it is a very important and valid one.

Routine Proceedings
First of all, I want to indicate that they would become documents of the committee the same as any other documents and therefore under their referencing process.
One of the things that I think is very important that we want to be very clear on, is that we are not asking that these documents be treated as Hansard documents and thus have to be put through the whole translation process, but that the members would be able to table their documents in the language of their choice and they would then become the documents of the committee and cross-referenced as such.

Otto Jelinek (Minister of National Revenue):,Minister of National Revenue,ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS,QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER,,"(a)	Customs and Excise does not maintain detailed statistical data (i.e. volumes, values and remitted revenues) on the Postal and Courier Imports Remission Orders. However, it is estimated that, in 1991, 27 million parcels were released under the Postal Imports Remission Order (PIRO) and 2 million parcels under the Courier Imports Remission Order (CIRO).
(b)	Assuming an average value of $20 per parcel, and deducting 4.5 million gifts sent by mail, the total value of PIRO shipments in 1991 would be $450 million and the value of CIRO shipments would be $40 million.
(c)	Assuming an average combined duty and tax rate of 12%, the total revenue remitted in 1991 under PIRO would be $54 million and under CIRO it would be $4.8 million.
These orders were originally introduced in 1986 as a cost saving measure for the government in respect of the processing of very low valued postal and courier importations. At that time, it cost the department approximately $10 to process, classify and collect duties and taxes on such shipments. Therefore, it was determined that for the vast majority of transactions involved, the cost of collecting significantly exceeded the revenue lost. In keeping with government priorities of fiscal responsibility and administrative efficiency, $40 was chosen as the appropriate limit at that time.
The government has established an interdepartmental committee to investigate fully and make recommendations respecting the effect these orders are having on the Canadian mail order industry.

John McDermid (Minister of State (Finance and Privatization)) moved,Minister of State (Finance and Privatization),GOVERNMENT ORDERS,CANADA DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"that Bill C-48, an act to amend the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and to amend other acts in consequence thereof, be read the second time and referred to Legislative Committee F.
February 5, 1992

He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to lead off the debate on Bill C-48. This bill contains amendments to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act that will expand the range of options available to the government for dealing with troubled financial institutions. These amendments will give the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation the authority to arrange and carry out the sale of troubled federally regulated financial institutions to a healthy institution.
At the outset I would like to say that one of the things we discovered when we went back to our ridings and talked about what goes on in the House, whether it be Question Period or debates in the House of Commons, is that we as parliamentarians take for granted that those who are watching us on television know what we are talking about.
Therefore, if I might for just a brief second explain that the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is a Crown corporation under the responsibility of the Minister of State for Finance and Privatization, provides insurance for depositors, for people who invest their money in financial institutions. It provides insurance coverage of up to $60,000 for each depositor.
Today we are talking about and I will be speaking on amendments to the act which allow the CDIC, the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation, some methods of further ensuring the safety of the deposits of Canadians in financial institutions. That is what we are going to be talking about today.
I am sure that hon. members will recall that we first proposed some restructuring of the financial institutions in a blue paper on financial sector reform.
My colleague, the Secretary of State for External Affairs is here today. I believe that she as Minister of State for Finance, started that process. I am pleased that she is here today to see that the reform she started is carrying on.
That proposal followed a report from then Mr. Justice Bud Estey who examined the Canadian Commercial Bank and the Northland Bank failures. As a result of that examination, Judge Estey concluded that existing
Government Orders
procedures and powers for dealing with failing institutions needed to be enhanced.
Major elements of the reforms set out in the blue paper have already been considered and endorsed by this House. It is now time to complete this process of reform and give speedy passage to this remaining piece of legislation.

Major elements of the reforms set out in the blue paper have already been considered and endorsed by this House. It is time now to complete the process of reform already begun and to give speedy passage to the other amendments contained in the bill.

As the federal deposit insurer, CDIC can be exposed to substantial potential losses when the financial difficulties of a member institution lead to the erosion of the institution's capital. This bill adds to CDIC's capacity to control exposure to loss by giving CDIC the necessary means and procedures to act in a timely manner to restructure a failing institution. The result will be a more cost effective deposit insurance system. Participants in this system, including depositors and CDIC member institutions, stand to benefit.
The quick resolution of difficulties which may arise at deposit taking institutions holds an additional benefit for depositors. The period of uncertainty and speculation which can be created by the prospect of a failing institution can be avoided if action is promptly taken. This bill makes it possible to deal more effectively with failing institutions and reduce disruptions in Canadians' financial dealings.
Before describing these new measures more fully, allow me to take a moment to note the ways in which the federal government can deal with a deposit taking institution in serious financial difficulty.
If this troubled financial institution lacks the financial resources needed to solve its difficulties, it generally faces one of two prospects. One is liquidation; the other is the sale or merger of its operation with a healthy institution.

Government Orders
In liquidation the institution is broken up and its assets are sold. The sale proceeds go toward paying the institution's liabilities.
On the other hand, if a buyer or merger partner is found, the institution's business can be preserved and liabilities will be paid as they come due.

Madam Speaker, a deposit taking institution's branches and the relationships formed between the institution and its customers are among its most important assets.

When a troubled deposit-taking institution is closed and subsequently liquidated, its relationships with customers, both depositors and borrowers, will be cut off and the value of the branch network reduced. If the institution's branches are well established, this may mean not only a disruption of many people's financial affairs but also may considerably reduce the net worth of the institution by destroying its value as a going concern.
Preserving maximum value in a troubled deposit taking institution is in the best interest of the institution's depositors and creditors and the deposit insurer. However, once a deposit taking institution's capital falls below a certain level, shareholders may find themselves in a position in which they have little left to lose by the institution's further decline. At this stage declines in the value of the assets of the institution will be borne more and more by the creditors of the institution, its uninsured depositors and the deposit insurer. This can lead to a situation in which the shareholders' ability to block a sale or merger can be used to extract payment from CDIC or public authorities.
Though the shares of the institution have little or no value at this point, CDIC may find that it has to pay shareholders more than the true value of the shares to get them to agree to a transaction which preserves the value of the failing institution.
Bill C-48 contains measures to deal with this situation and gives federal authorities more control over the cost of resolving serious financial difficulties which may arise. The measures in this bill accomplish this goal while still respecting the rights of shareholders.
The restructuring process vests all ownership rights in the troubled institution in CDIC and makes CDIC responsible for managing the institution's restructuring. As sole shareholder, CDIC can approve any restructuring proposal. This could include the sale of the shares of the institution to one or more buyers, an amalgamation of the institution with another, or the sale of its assets and liabilities. Shareholders and subordinated debt holders will be compensated for the value of their shares and debt claims.
CDIC's use of the new restructuring measures will be guided by the pursuit of the objectives set out for CDIC in its act. These objectives are to provide deposit insurance, to promote high standards of business and financial practices, to promote the stability and competitiveness of the financial system in Canada, and to pursue these objectives for the benefit of depositors and in a manner which minimizes CDIC's exposure to loss.
These objectives provide assurance that the competitiveness and stability of the financial system, as well as the cost to CDIC, will be prime factors in determining how to resolve financial difficulties which may arise at CDIC member institutions.
The new powers granted to CDIC in this bill are appropriate, given the risk that CDIC bears and given the need to take decisive action when serious financial difficulties arise.
Nevertheless, these powers require that they be balanced by measures which ensure that shareholders and holders of subordinated debt are treated fairly.
The restructuring provisions in this bill accomplish this in two ways.
First, there is a set of conditions precedent which must be considered before a financial institution restructuring
February 5, 1992

process can be ordered. These conditions and the series of approvals required will prevent premature or arbitrary use of the power to restructure troubled deposit taking institutions.
Second, shareholders and subordinated debt holders of an institution that is restructured will be compensated according to the value remaining in the shares or debt. This is assured by their right to request that an independent assessor be appointed to determine what fair compensation is.
These safeguards are very important features of this bill.
Now let me take a few moments to describe in greater detail how they will work.
Before the authority to restructure a troubled financial institution can be used, certain conditions must be considered and a detailed procedure involving the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Minister of Finance and the federal cabinet must be followed.
The first step is the superintendent's judgment of the financial condition of the troubled institution. Specifically the superintendent must determine that the institution has ceased or is about to cease to be viable and that there is no regulatory power that the superintendent can use to restore or preserve the viability of the institution. The superintendent must then report to CDIC on the condition of this institution.
I might say that these two organizations do co-operate greatly and meet together with myself, the minister responsible, on a monthly basis to review the situation with our financial institutions.
CDIC must in turn decide whether it is appropriate to recommend to the Minister of Finance that the troubled institution be restructured. In making this decision, CDIC must be satisfied that a restructuring is consistent with the objectives set out in its act.
If CDIC recommends a restructuring of the troubled institution, the minister must assess the financial condition of the institution question and be satisfied that it has ceased, or is about to cease to be viable. Only then may the minister recommend to the Governor in Council that a restructuring order be made.
Government Orders
The assessment of the institution by the superintendent and the minister will be guided by criteria which will be set out in the act for owners and operators of financial institutions.
Put simply, the criteria will describe an institution that is no longer capable of continuing on its own. Evidence of this condition may include the institution's excessive dependence on financial assistance to sustain its operation, the loss of the public's and depositors' confidence, substantial impairment of capital, and the institution's inability to pay its liabilities.
These criteria give clear guidance to all concerned that the restructuring authority provided in the bill should only be used when the condition of the institution warrants.
The conditions which must be considered before an institution can be restructured are coupled in the bill with measures to ensure that when an institution is restructured, shareholders and subordinated debt holders will be treated fairly.
Most important among these are the measures dealing with compensation. Where the shares and subordinated debt of a restructured institution have value, their holders will be offered compensation from CDIC. If 10 per cent or more of a class of shareholders or subordinated debt holders feel that CDIC's offer is too low, they will have the option of seeking the appointment of an independent assessor to determine what is fair compensation.
The assessor, who will be a judge, will have full powers to hear evidence and will be given broad terms of reference for determining the appropriate level of compensation. If, for example, the assessor finds that a higher level of compensation should be paid then CDIC will be required to pay.
We have tried to strike a balance in this bill between the objectives of economic and financial stability on one hand and respect for the normal property rights of shareholders and subordinate debt holders on the other. I am confident, after working on this bill for some time, that we have achieved such a balance.
I would like to turn now to some other features of this bill. The bill contains a small number of amendments which are not directly related to the financial institution restructuring process. The first of these is aimed at

February 5, 1992
Government Orders
improving the flow of information about deposit insurance to customers of financial institutions. Until the existing CDIC act, employees of CDIC member institutions could not provide even the most basic information about deposit insurance to customers. The amendment will improve this situation by allowing CDIC member institutions to provide their customers with more information regarding deposit insurance. This is an important step toward improving the public's understanding of deposit insurance coverage and, I might add, is welcomed by the industry.
The second amendment provides for an increase in CDIC's borrowing limit from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to $6 billion. The last increase was in 1987 when the limit was raised to $3 billion. Since then, insured deposits in our financial institutions in Canada have grown by 50 per cent. The proposed increase will accommodate this growth and cover anticipated increases in insured deposits over the next few years.
Other amendments are of a more technical nature but are nonetheless important for CDIC's operations. These amendments will give CDIC greater flexibility to make by-laws to promote a common standard of business practice and conditions of insurance coverage among the member institutions.
The amendments contained in this bill will permit the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to cany out its mandate more effectively. The process set out in this bill for the restructuring of federal deposit taking institutions will contribute to the health and stability of the financial system and help control the cost of the deposit insurance system.
Other changes in Bill C-48 will support the important goals of achieving common standards of business and financial practices and providing the public with greater access to information on deposit insurance. I look forward to the participation in the debate of colleagues from the opposition benches. They have been afforded and have taken up the offer to be briefed by departmental officials. I hope their questions and concerns have been answered to their satisfaction.
I look forward to the debate. I believe that once the bill is carefully examined, all parties will see its wisdom and ensure its passage in a reasonable period of time.
I understand that consultations have been taken with the opposition parties and therefore I move:
That pursuant to Standing Order 73(3), Bill C-48, an act to amend
the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and to amend other
acts in consequence thereof, be referred to the Standing Committee
on Finance.

First of all I want to say that we in the Liberal Party will be supporting this legislation at second reading. Its purpose is to give the federal government the power to try to save a failing bank or trust company by seizing the assets of the institution and either restructuring the company or arranging a merger with a healthy institution.
At present, one of the problems with the present legislation is that the regulator does not have the power to intervene early enough in some cases to protect the shareholders, consumers and the debt holders.
I said that we on this side of the House will support this legislation at second reading, but there are a number of issues that we will want to address when this legislation goes to committee.
One of those issues is how to prevent regulators from using their new powers arbitrarily. In other words, we want to make sure that they do not abuse this power by moving too quickly or prematurely to take over the assets of a trust company or a bank.
On the other hand, we do not want to see banks or trust companies go under. People lose money: creditors, depositors, and shareholders.
As well, many people would be laid off. In this industry the banks and trust companies employ over 400,000 Canadians across this country. The importance of keeping Canadians at work becomes even more important when we are in a recession as we are today where we have 1.5 million Canadians unemployed.
February 5, 1992

We want to be very cautious about giving these regulators the massive powers outlined under Bill C-48. We will spend a lot of time in committee studying it very closely.
I believe that the alternative to this would be worse, in other words if we did not pass this legislation. The situation that we presently have is that the regulators do not have the power to intervene early enough in some cases to protect our consumers, our depositors and our shareholders adequately.
I see no reason to hold up the second reading of this legislation. Before I begin discussing Bill C-48,1 would like to put this legislation in historical context.
In 1985, I am sure that we all recall the two western banks that failed: Canadian Commercial and the Northland. That prompted an inquiry by the government. In August 1986, the Hon. Mr. Justice Willard Estey submitted his report. In that report he argued that the public would be well served if regulators had the power to force a bank or a trust company that is facing bankruptcy or insolvency, to restructure or to merge with another financial institution.
Mr. Justice Estey proposed that the regulator would have the responsibility by statute to recommend which course of action-liquidation or a merger or restructuring-would be appropriate in the circumstances and to seek the authority of the Minister of Finance to proceed. That was in August of 1986.
In December 1986 the government produced a blue paper. It looked as though it was going to move very quickly on the recommendation of Mr. Justice Estey, but all we received was a blue paper.
In that paper they proposed the recommendation that if an institution, a bank or a trust company is faced with insolvency, the federal cabinet would have the power to give control of the institution to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
According to the blue paper, conditions would be set out. In other words, it would be very clear as to when they would have the power to do this. Also, it would be spelled out how the creditors and the shareholders would be compensated. That was back in 1986 and here we are six years later, after that blue paper, and the
Government Orders
government has finally tabled this recommendation and this legislation we have before us, Bill C-48.
The question is: Why did the government wait for six years? That is a question that is very difficult for me to understand because this is something that is extremely important to the financial industry.
I want to detail some of the main points of Bill C-48, paying particular attention to the restructuring process. That is the main thrust of the bill. Of the 20-page bill most of it is devoted to this restructuring.
Before I do that, I want to take a minute and talk about the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation which was established in 1967 to provide insurance for depositors who put their money into banks or trust companies. That insurance covers up to $60,000. Really, it is an insurance for deposits or for people who put their money into banks and trust companies in this country and, therefore, it helps to promote the stability of the Canadian financial system.
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation is financed by the premiums that are paid by the banks and trust companies that belong to this corporation. It does insure over 150 Canadian financial institutions.
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as insuring deposits, guarantees loans to unhealthy financial institutions and it prescribes the standards of sound business and financial practice for financial institutions.
Of course, working closely with this corporation is the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, because he has to inspect and regulate the federal financial institutions that are under this corporation.
This restructuring process, as I mentioned, really provides that a bank or a trust company that is facing bankruptcy or insolvency can be seized by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation which will then restructure or merge it with a healthy institution.
In order to ensure that these special powers are used appropriately, in other words that they are not used unjustly and the corporation does not act prematurely, the legislation sets out a lot of conditions. For example, the corporation must get a report from the Superintendent of Financial Institutions stating that the financial institution is no longer viable.
Then the corporation has to take that report to the Minister of Finance and convince him that the institu-

February 5, 1992
Government Orders
tion must be seized, that they can arrange a rescue package and that it has a potential buyer or merger partner.
Before the finance minister can agree or disagree he must hear from the directors of the financial institutions so that they have their opportunity to put their case before the minister.
If the minister still agrees with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation then the corporation takes over the institution and the shareholders and the debt holders are offered compensation, if there is any value left in the institution.
Each individual shareholder and debt holder can decide whether he or she going to take that compensation. If over 10 per cent reject the offer, an independent assessor will be appointed who determines whether the offer was fair and, if not, what the amount of money should be.
That is a summary of the restructuring process. Certainly it is not perfect, but it does try to strike a balance on the one hand between the need for decisive action to save a failing financial institution. As I said, presently and in the past the regulator has not had the power to go in there in some cases as quickly as he probably should have. It tries to strike a balance between the need for decisive action to save a financial institution and on the other hand the need to respect the rights of that institution's shareholders and debt holders. That is not an easy balance to find. However I think this legislation has come up with a reasonable balance. It is one that we will be looking at very closely in the committee.
There are some other elements in the bill as well. For example, other measures include that the corporation's line of credit will be increased to $6 billion from $3 billion. That is money which the corporation lends at market prices to carry out such duties as financing a merger or compensating depositors or shareholders or debt holders. Since 1987 the level of deposits of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation has increased by more than 50 per cent. That makes it necessary to increase this line of credit.
Another important measure contained in this bill will mean that bank and trust company staff will be able to tell their customers which products are insured under Canada deposit insurance. As it presently stands, Madam Speaker, if you go into a bank or a trust company and you want to find out what particular products are insured under Canada deposit insurance, they cannot tell you. All they can do is give you a pamphlet. Sometimes those pamphlets are very confusing. Sometimes it is very difficult to know just exactly what is included, what you can have insured up to $60,000.
This is a very important step. It is going to make it much more convenient for customers because they will be able to ask personnel at the bank or the trust company and receive an answer as to yes, it is insured or no, it is not insured.
This legislation affects banks and trust companies. It is interesting to read their comments on how they feel about regulators getting this massive power which seems to give Draconian powers to the federal government through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
For example, the trust companies association president, John Evans, said on February 3 in The Globe and Mail: ""We are encouraging the government to proceed and get this through. Our sense is there is some urgency. This bill provides the powers the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation needs to come to a quick resolution of problem institutions"".
The Canadian Bankers' Association is on record as saying that it agrees with the concept of this legislation. It would prefer a more comprehensive review of the role and operations of the corporation. It notes that in 1985 the Wyman report recommended sweeping changes to the corporation which would, among other things, result in higher insurance premiums for riskier financial institutions. In other words, the riskier a financial institution was, the higher the premium it would have to pay.
This legislation appears to be reasonable. We will have to examine it in detail in the committee. However, one of the things that is not reasonable is the fact that this government took six years to bring in this legislation, from the time of the blue paper in 1986 which first described the process we are now discussing in this Bill C-48. Now we have the legislation before us and the government wants to pass it by the end of the month.
February 5, 1992

What I am saying is that the government has taken six years to take the recommendations from the blue paper and incorporate them into legislation, but it wants it passed by the end of the month.
The question is: Why did the government not come forward sooner with this legislation? Why did it take six years on a matter of such obvious importance to the Canadian financial institutions? The customers of at least one financial institution might have been better off if the government had not taken its time in introducing Bill C-48.
The financial papers today are reporting almost daily how the sale of 48 branches of Central Guaranty Trust to National Bank is being held up by creditors and possibly by shareholders and how the regulator is against the sale.
While these negotiations continue behind closed doors, the customers of Central Guaranty live in uncertainty over what is going to happen to their institution.
On a broader level, why is the government not acting on the broad recommendations of the 1985 Wyman report? The federal government commissioned the report, yet seven years later it is still on the shelf gathering dust.
A third problem with the government's approach is that the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation has no power to seize a provincial incorporated institution that might be on the verge of bankruptcy, even though it insures the deposits of the institution.
Of course the reason for this is that the government has made practically no progress in harmonizing its financial regulations with those of the provinces.
During the sweeping financial reforms that we dealt with last fall in this House and in the finance committee, we heard trust companies, banks and insurance companies pleading with the government to talk to the provinces to come to some agreement on harmonizing financial regulations.
At the moment, these companies often have to deal with 11 regulators and 11 sets of rules. This means incredible duplication and red tape and, of course, the cost of that. We can imagine the cost of dealing with 11 regulators and 11 sets of rules, but the cost really is passed along to the customers.
Government Orders
In a speech last week, the Canadian Bankers' Association president, Helen Sinclair, said the overlap of federal and provincial powers is costly and confusing. She said: ""This is very important. When rules differ, confusion reigns"".
Certainly we in the Liberal Party have been pressing the government time after time to speed up talks with the provinces on harmonization for financial institutions.
I just want to conclude my remarks on Bill C-48 by restating my party's initial support for the second reading of this legislation. It will help to protect the stability of the Canadian financial system and will not infringe unreasonably on the rights of shareholders and debt holders.
Some work still needs to be done. We will need to consult with the financial services industry to hear their detailed concerns and also their recommended improvements.
The government certainly needs to step up its harmonization talks with the provinces.

They have a tendency to not want to listen.
You must consider the background of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the reasons for its existence, and what has happened in the United States over deregulation, and now with the new banking regulations. We have seen some of the problems, particularly through the 1980s, in our trust companies and closely held banks. It is very clear that the banking legislation and this legislation before us affects every one of us.
What is the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation? I think the minister touched on it briefly, but it is interesting and I think it will be worth while in my remarks to touch on it a little bit more for those who are watching and read from the corporate profile of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
It states:
The objects of the Corporation are to provide insurance against the loss of part or all deposits, to be instrumental in the promotion of standards of sound business and financial practices for member institutions, and to promote and otherwise contribute to the stability and competitiveness of the financial system in Canada. These objects are to be pursued for the benefit of persons having deposits with

Government Orders
member institutions and in such a manner as will minimize the exposure of corporations to loss.
Tb fulfil its objects, CDIC may, among other things, acquire assets from a member institution; make or guarantee loans to a member; make or cause to be made inspections of member institutions; prescribe standards of sound business and financial practices for members; and act as a liquidator, receiver or inspector of a member institution or subsidiary thereof.
This particular object of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation I think is one that most of us in this House agree with. Certainly in my party, we agree with the object of the protection and the ability of such an institution to move in and insure the deposits, particularly those of our minor depositors, shareholders and debenture holders.
My friend from the Liberal Party has pointed out the problem of harmonization which I will touch on later.
There are, I believe, 35 provincially incorporated financial institutions that are also covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. Yet CDIC does not have the same power to move in as it does with federally instituted organizations. I identify this as a potential problem for the whole situation concerning Canadian deposit insurance.
If we look at the bill now before the House, I believe the principle of the bill will assist all depositors and will assist banks and financial institutions in overcoming a problem that they have run into over the last little while.
To demonstrate the problems they have run into over the last little while we only have to note the failure of the Canadian Commercial Bank the Northland Bank, the Mercantile Bank, the Continental Bank, and Principal Trust. They affected each and every one of us and made us realize that we have to go a step further than we have so far to try to protect our financial institutions.
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation was instituted in approximately 1967 and is used by many banks. Over that period of time we can see some problems arising, as demonstrated by a recent article by Karen Howlett, financial reporter for The Globe and Mail, on February 3 of this year. She tells us that the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation ran up a deficit of $642.6 million as of December 31, 1990 as a result of rescuing
several companies in the eighties, and that does not include Standard Thist Co. which collapsed last year costing the agency more than $1 billion, the single most expensive bailout in CDIC's 25-year history. CDIC provided another $445 million in loans and guarantees for last month's rescue of the First City Trust Company.
She goes on to say: ""The troubled state of many companies is also fuelling debate in the industry over how CDIC finances its bailouts. The agency collects premiums from the industry, one-tenth of one per cent of the total insured deposits, for a total of $271 million in 1990"". She says that most of the burden has fallen to taxpayers. CDIC borrowed about $1.2 billion from the government's consolidated revenue fund as of December 31, 1990.
Under this bill, as has been pointed out by the minister and my friend from the Liberal Party, the government is extending the CDIC's ability to borrow from the consolidated revenue fund, by extending its limit from $3 billion to $6 billion in order to support what has been an increasing burden within the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
I would suggest that, given what we went through just prior to the Christmas season with our four major banking bills and the breakdown of the four pillars of the banking institution within Canada, with this bill we are going to reap some of the unfortunate costs of those pillars falling.
As my friend from Nickel Belt has said in speaking on the banking acts, the Hulk Hogans, the wrestlers of the banking community, are now turning into the sumo wrestlers of the banking community. Where there were a number of Hulk Hogans there will now be one, two or three major sumo wrestlers who will slowly take over the banking community as a result of what we have seen occurring. The breakdown of those pillars gives those large banks, in particular the five major banks within Canada and some of the other major trust companies and insurance companies, the ability to take over those smaller banks, those smaller closely held financial institutions, and those smaller trust companies that cannot make it in a deregulated system.

To some extent the changes within this bill are a reflection of the problems that we have predicted within the banking legislation. They will lead potentially to the large ones taking advantage of the system we have set up to gobble up some of the smaller failing trust companies, some of the smaller failing closely held financial institutions, once again proving that the larger will become larger and the smaller financial institutions will cease to exist.
It seems to me in the interests of the larger financial institutions to sit and wait and use the merger terms to be set out within this legislation to their benefit, to wait until the share structure goes down to buy up the shares of the financial institutions with the blessing of CDIC and use an injection of funds from the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to assist in refinancing and restructuring within that merger.
That is one of the problems I see with this legislation.
The advantage of the legislation is also within that same section in which the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation has the ability to ensure that shareholders and dividend holders do not take advantage of the system. When certain conditions occur, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Minister of Finance, and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation can take certain actions to ensure that they can take over the ownership of that company-in other words, the ownership of that financial institution that is in trouble and is no longer a viable institution-thereby ensuring that shareholders who perhaps have nothing to lose by letting the company go down further and hold out for a higher amount of money for their shares will be stuck with accepting a deal with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and will be assured of only receiving the value of the shares. That is a positive.
That perhaps insures depositors' savings, as we have seen in the past with the takeover by the Bank of Hong Kong of the Bank of British Columbia in which a merger was worked out. Although I believe it cost $240 million to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, it in fact saved a failure of a bank that was having problems, a provincially incorporated bank that was having problems,
Government Orders
and would perhaps have failed with the result that depositors could not have got their money out.
As one who has lost money to uninsured deposits within certain financial institutions, I applaud what has been called a minor part of this particular bill which ensures that the financial institutions are able to notify their customers properly whether the deposit they have made in the institution is properly insured.
It is often in talking to people since I have been a member of Parliament and prior to that in my past occupation as a lawyer, where I have found out that many people, often seniors with small amounts of money, would deposit the money in financial institutions or in trust companies where they felt that they would get a better return on their money only to find out, often too late as in the case of some of the trust companies and financial institutions that have failed, that they were not insured by CDIC.
This is a positive step in ensuring that the CDIC member institutions will be able to provide their customers with more information with respect to deposit insurance. I applaud this move, as will people within Canada.
Let me move quickly, Madam Speaker, to what the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will be looking at in trying to see whether or not a financial institution is still viable. In looking to see whether a merger or sale of the company is viable, the CDIC and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will look at whether that company has ceased or is about to cease to be viable, whether it is independent and relies to an excessive extent on loans to sustain its operation or has lost the confidence of the depositors and the public and whether it has regulatory capital or is about to become substantially deficient.
Under section 39.1 and throughout, it sets out the various steps that will be taken once that comes. There are 12 particular steps. I will not go through them all but I will highlight a couple of them. First of all, the troubled federally regulated institution reports major losses and OSFI, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, will explore with the company measures to strengthen the institution. When it is deemed that there is an appropriate situation for restructuring, CDIC may recommend to the minister that a restructuring order be made, vesting the shares and the subordinated debt of

Government Orders
that institution in the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
CDIC will inform the shareholders and the subordinated debt holders of the fact that this particular step has been ordered and they will offer compensation to indicate that there will be no compensation to be offered. The shareholders and subordinated debt holders can accept or reject CDIC's offer and those who accept the offer are entitled to the amount offered and are not party to any assessment procedure which may take place.
If fewer than 10 per cent reject CDIC's offer, all shareholders and subordinated debt holders will receive the compensation offer. If there are 10 per cent more of the class that reject the offer, then an independent assessor is appointed. I think that is a positive step.
This idea is to ensure that there are not the major losses that we have seen in the past in shoring up, even though it may cost CDIC some capital and some money to get it going. Certainly the losses will be substantially fewer than the potential losses in things such as the Principal Trust, Northlands Bank, et cetera.
I referred earlier to the matter of harmonization. It certainly is a question that has arisen time and again with the banking legislation and I suggest, as has my friend from the Liberals, that in this particular case once again we are running into the problem with the harmonization between provincially regulated institutions and federally regulated institutions.
In this particular case, even though there are 35 provincially regulated financial institutions that are insured under CDIC, the financial institution restructuring process that is one of the major thrusts of this amendment cannot be brought to bear on the provincially instituted institutions. This legislation fails totally to address that particular issue. The paper put out by the government at our briefing session simply says: ""Will CDIC's power under the FIRP legislation extend to provincial deposit taking institutions? Can CDIC take over a provincial led institution? The answer is simply no. Only federally regulated deposit taking institutions will come under the new legislation"".
Without that harmonization, once again we have the uncertainty of the depositors, the uncertainty of the shareholders and dividend holders. Most people do not know whether the institutions they are depositing their life savings in are federally or provincially regulated institutions. They see a big building. They go in, the people are nice and they deposit their money. They say: ""Is my money safe here?"" ""Oh, yes, we are all covered"". They go away thinking their money is totally insured and they do not have a problem. It is not until we have a failure and these people who have worked for years and years and saved toward their retirement find out that they are totally without insurance and are left without their life's savings.
I would suggest it is not a very nice feeling for many of these people who have lost funds through some of these failures in western Canada, to have worked their lifetime and seen that security dissolve when they thought they were insured. They thought that once they deposited their money with an institution there was some expectation that it would make money and assist them in then-retirement years.
Some agreement with the provinces must be looked at to ensure that it falls under FIRP and is regulated more closely by the CDIC legislation.
Another thing I would like to point out is that the relationship between CDIC, the insurance function and OSFI, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the regulatory function, is not clear. As my friend from Nickel Belt has often pointed out, we know that OSFI and CDIC have a close working relationship, but is that working relationship that of Siamese twins or is it of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde nature? Under this legislation it appears that the Office of the Superintendent of Finance Institutions is losing ground to CDIC.
The other issue is the wish to know who controls CDIC. With the expansion of CDIC's board we have the chartered banks being allowed as part of the regulatory body. Perhaps with more of those senior officials being from the banks, that representation may skewer exactly where we should be going.
I suggest that the legislation in principle is good legislation which can be supported by this party. However, there are some changes that must be made during
February 5, 1992

committee work that will make it better for shareholders, dividend holders and depositors as well as the institutions that are covered by CDIC.
In conclusion, I simply say we can support the bill at second reading. Hopefully the government will pay attention to projected changes that we will make.

3893077,ca.proc.d.1992-02-05.4.2.1.5,1992-02-05,615f281f-2c98-4b52-a94d-3604494de29d,ca.m.7064,Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,CANADA DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on this particular bill. As has been indicated by my colleague from Malpeque, we will be supporting this legislation as it goes through second reading and look forward to studying it in committee. This legislation is long overdue, particularly when you look at the fact that Mr. Justice Estey submitted a report a number of years ago.
We have been waiting for that report for a long period of time in order to see something take place. I believe the date was in 1986.
The bulk of the recommendations that Mr. Justice Estey made are now encompassed in this legislation. One wonders why all of a sudden we are in this huriy-up mode when it has been roughly five years since those recommendations have been made.
The problems have existed for a number of years, and the government could have acted quickly if it wanted to. We might have averted some of the problems had the government taken the time to move quickly. Instead, we see it going the other way, waiting and crisis management.
Now we are facing another crisis management situation dealing with Central Trust. The shareholders are about to vote and we are rushing legislation off to committee and looking for ways to plug the holes in the dike, rather than having good, constructive legislation. For that reason we want to co-operate because I think there is a benefit from this legislation. It is just unfortunate that this benefit could not have been around earlier to help others.
As my colleague from Malpeque has said, the main purpose of this bill is to block the system where shareholders can do things to their advantage and to the disadvantage of depositors and other players in the system. That is one of the major intents of the legislation.
On its face, it is good legislation. The problem that we face under the existing situation is that as soon as the
Government Orders
Superintendent of Financial Institutions starts to investigate an institution, it is like announcing the death-knell of that institution. Depositors start to flee that financial institution for fear of losing their life savings or any investment in that institution.
Once the media carries the news that such and such a financial institution is shaky, that the superintendent is looking at it, that there are grave concerns as to its viability and all of those types of comments, then that institution is in trouble.
In every case, I believe, they have ultimately failed in some way and either have been bought out or, as in the case of Central Trust, some financial institution has come and cherry picked. They pick the best parts of it and leave the dregs for those minor shareholders and players who will ultimately suffer the greatest loss.
In that sense, this legislation is a positive step. It will allow the superintendent to come in and take the steps necessary to preserve the assets and perhaps even to preserve the company. Obviously that is a good and sound approach.
In that sense we are certainly not opposed to that measure. It becomes a measure that falls half way between the extreme of letting a company go down the drain, taking all the depositors and deposit insurance guarantees that have to be paid as a result of that along with them.
The other extreme is to have the superintendent force that situation by acknowledging they are involved in an examination of the company. This strikes a bit of a middle ground.
The problem is that it is done very quickly. In some sense, I am sure people will say that is a good idea and will preserve the institution. As we go through the scenario of things that could take place, it is almost like a Friday afternoon and Monday morning type situation. Everything is going to be done over the weekend.
The depositors and shareholders are not going to feel very pleased about that because it is so quick. A lot of it is going to be done quickly behind the scenes and not up front. One has to wonder whether the superintendent and the deposit insurance organization has been given too much power. What kind of controls will be on them?
Literally they can move on Friday and put together a deal over the weekend. People will find out about it on

Government Orders
Monday morning. That to me does connote some problems because of the speed in which that could take place. It is almost the speed in which this legislation has now been brought forward, because of the impending situation with National Bank cherry picking the good assets of Central Trust and leaving the dregs for others.
We on this side obviously want to co-operate with the government because we do see the benefits of this legislation. In the specific case of dealing with the institution that we hear about, this legislation could have some benefits to all of the players. Many small investors have put money in that organization, not just depositors. Grant it, they take the risk. Any time one buys stock on the stock market and is involved in that process one takes some risk. Many small investors with RRSPs and other investments are involved and run the risk of losing a portion of their RRSP or their investment because of decisions that might be taken.
This legislation will move in a positive sense by trying to control this situation. The bill allows CDIC to go around the major shareholders and allows a situation where the majority of smaller shareholders might benefit otherwise. It might be to the exclusion of different categories of shareholders so that the rich shareholders will benefit and the others will not.
There is a positive side to this legislation. That is why we are anxious to see it move on to committee. But we do have some concerns. When one looks at the legislation it does seem to be protecting shareholders and allowing a financial institution to stay viable. It really does not seem to be doing anything for depositors. As soon as there is a concern about a financial institution, the depositors move very quickly to take their resources out, which really precipitates the demise of that financial institution. If we could find ways to give the depositors a sense of confidence and a sense of trust, maybe these financial institutions would not be in the same circumstances and the same difficulty.
There is nothing in this legislation that deals with that. There is nothing in this legislation that gives confidence to the depositors. It essentially deals with the big financial institutions that are shoring up a financial institution in trouble. It deals with some of the major
shareholders. It does not deal with the little shareholders and it really does not deal with the depositors.
The area of harmonization has been referred to earlier and I think it bears repeating. We saw it when we considered legislation on financial institutions, banks, trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions, caisses populaires and the like. There is a dangerous situation in this country as it relates to financial institutions, that two levels of jurisdiction are regulating financial institutions. Helen Sinclair probably said it best when she said: ""When rules differ, confusion reigns"".
This is what we are actually seeing here with financial institutions. As we go through the constitutional debate, I am sure there will be more pressing problems and issues. If there were some way to develop some harmonization with our financial institutions then it would all be to the better.
This legislation will only deal with federal institutions. There are many provincial institutions that will not be touched by it. Therefore we still run the risk of seeing another Principal Group or another Northland Bank-type situation.
We have to go back and grapple with the issue of harmonization and deal with it.
We also have to take a look at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and CDIC taking over this new role as this legislation comes to the fore. Do they have the resources and the people in place to deal with what is involved? They will move very quickly. They will try to put together new deals very rapidly, as I said over the weekend. Do they have the resources to know how to put that together and the background to see that it is actually going to take place?
I confess that all politicians, except for the Speaker, of course, tend to talk about things we know very little about. From the little I know they run a lean mean machine at the OSFI office.
I am not sure whether they, working with CDIC, are going to have those resources to put into place. That is what will come out of our committee discussions to ensure that is the case and that the department, as well as CDIC, will have the resources to deal with this situation.
February 5, 1992

The other thing which I think is an obligation arising out of the committee study of this particular matter is that we have to try to ensure as much as possible that things are not done behind people's backs, that the system appears to function so that everyone has a say and everyone knows as much as possible what is going on. Again, the committee is going to have to look at that aspect of it to make sure that they do not go to bed one night and wake up the next morning to find out that they are now a shareholder in another organization and it is an organization that they did not want to be associated with.
In conclusion, we on this side are supportive of this legislation because we think that it will provide some benefits to Canadians and to people who invest in financial institutions and people who are depositors in those institutions. But there is still much to be done. We have to restore the confidence of Canadians in our financial institutions. They have been sorely tested.
All we have to do, and I digress, is to consider that banks are making profits in the vicinity of $3 billion or $4 billion while the rest of the country is going to hell in a hand basket. We wonder about financial institutions and what is actually going on and why there is that kind of resource and that kind of profit taking going on in financial institutions and yet others are allowed to get
Government Orders
into the types of problems that we see. I think there is an obligation on the financial institutions themselves to be contributors to this process and to make sure that it works.
We on this side will be supporting the legislation to go to committee. We look forward to working with the different organizations that are involved in making this legislation better legislation.
