The news last night and this morning indicated that the hon. member for Lotbiniere has been convicted of misuse of funds of the House of Commons. Members of the House obviously have refrained from making any comments until the final resolution had taken place.
We have learned of the conviction and now the House must decide. Normally the member would have resigned and maybe that has already taken place. Perhaps I could seek some information from the government side.
It is the tradition of this House always to discipline its members in addition to the discipline meted out by the
courts.
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you give some guidance regarding the consideration of taking action on this case. If there is a particular course of action to be taken I would be prepared of course to move the appropriate motion.

There is a convention which I expect would be followed. It is that the court will inform the Chair officially of what has transpired. I do not anticipate receiving that this morning or maybe not even for some days.
The other matter referred to is the question of an appeal. I am not in a position, nor I suppose are hon. colleagues, to know whether an appeal would be taken. I think we should look carefully at that.
Again, we do not know what is likely to transpire at the sentencing or what arguments may be used by the defence at that time, all of which would affect whatever action this place might ultimately take.
We had a matter like this some years ago. Hon. members will remember that I took the matter under advisement to consider my position and to consider what was appropriate under the circumstances. As it turned out, the matter was resolved without the necessity of the Chair having to make any ruling at all.
However, the hon. member for Kamloops has, as he said, brought this matter to the attention of the House at the first possible opportunity. If I understood him correctly, he is not suggesting that the House should take any sudden action today, but when it is appropriate under all the circumstances.
I will take the application of the hon. member under advisement. As soon as I am in a position to advise the House further I shall do so.

Bill 88 is much more than a mere legal provision. For New Brunswick's Acadian community, Bill 88 was intended to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Acadian men and women as expressed at the Convention d'orientation nationale des Acadiens, held in 1979 in Edmundston, the principal town in my riding.
I participated in that convention, and the spirit that inspired it bore witness to the courage and determination to equip the Acadian community with the tools it needed for its cultural, linguistic and economic development. Important steps had already been taken at that time.
Former Premier Robichaud, now a senator, had embarked on major reforms, particularly the Official Languages Act and the equal opportunities for all programs. Under the leadership of his successor, Premier Hatfield, and his minister, Jean Maurice Simard, also a senator now, several further reforms were implemented, such as duality in the Department of Education, community centres, schools and so forth.",,,,

First, it confirms almost inalienably the road that the two communities have taken together for many years now, the progress they have made together and the future they want to build together as partners, not opponents.
It testifies to an irreversible social maturity that wants to develop a common existence and pass on to future generations of New Brunswickers their desire to continue this social and economic experiment.
This resolution enables anglophone communities which are in a minority situation in some areas to take control of their own cultural and linguistic development in the field of education and other government services.
In a community like Madawaska-Victoria, my riding, the main town, Edmonston, a small community of 12,000 people, has a population of only 4 per cent of anglophones. Because of the spirit in New Brunswick and because of that duality, these people have separate school boards in my home town, district 33.

In other words, not only did they support the constitutional amendment that particularly affected them, but they were still sufficiently generous to accept the other compromises that would have put us on the road to greater national solidarity and consequently greater prosperity.

It is not every day that I agree with the Minister of Employment and Immigration, but I am delighted to get up today to support his motion.

As you all know, becoming the member for Beausejour was probably one of the finest moments of my political career.

To get up today and to speak on this motion gives me great pleasure. The minister referred to an historic moment and it is, indeed, a big one.
It is Canada at its best. This is the generosity, the tolerance, the diversity that has made this country what it is. This is what we are enshrining in the Constitution for New Brunswick.

Going around that riding in the past two years, I realized that a third of my constituents were Englishspeaking and two-thirds were French-speaking. They all live together, but they have their own schools. They share a common life but are separate at the same time.

When you are in Sackville, Dorchester, Cape Tormen-tine, Port Elgin, you have people who came from the United States to Canada. They were Loyalists who wanted to remain part of what they believed in. In those days it was the British Empire. They did not want to join the American revolution.
December 11, 1992



Then you go to the other side, to Cap-Pele, Shediac, Buctouche and you see these French speaking people, these Acadians, who were deported and came back, but who kept the French language and culture in absolutely incredible conditions. They are proud of their Frenchness, they are proud of speaking French and very proud of being New Brunswickers; nothing will stop them from remaining French speaking. They are very proud to be Canadian.
If that spirit prevailed in the country from coast to coast, I think it would be the best example that Canada could give to the whole world. When we see the problems in the world today, where people kill one another because of cultural or language differences and you go to New Brunswick or to my riding, the smallest English speaking communities have their school commission, the French speaking community has its school commissions and they live and work together for the economic progress of that community; this is Canada at its best.
Today, as I speak in this House as the member for Beausejour, I am pleased to support this motion, because in the history of New Brunswick and especially of the French community in New Brunswick, they have taken their destiny in hand, with this unfailing perseverance and determination.
The minister talked about Senator Robichaud, who decided to shake New Brunswick's cage, so to speak, by proposing to make the two language communities equal. Later Richard Hatfield took up the torch and today Premier Frank McKenna is continuing to advance the cause.

For me it is a great day. It is an example that we can be together and at the same time be different in Canada. I have my colleagues with me. The member for Moncton and the other members live that by the day. They are all elected, every one of them, by francophones and anglophones. They manage to keep them happy.
That is the way I would like this country to work. It is not the Charlottetown accord or anything else. This is a commitment of these two communities that was done a long time ago. When we amended the Constitution in 1982, we made provisions so that some amendments could be made to the Constitution in a bilateral way between the provincial and the federal governments.
Government Orders
That is exactly why it is there. There are some elements in the Constitution that affect only one province. It will not be unique to New Brunswick. For example, in Newfoundland they have the duality of the school system based on religion. This does not exist in other provinces. The same thing exists in Quebec. It is not the case in Ontario and other provinces. We need to have that flexibility in the Constitution. It is being used for a very noble purpose today.
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is a great example of understanding, generosity, tolerance and diversity.

Since I will unfortunately not be a candidate in the riding of Beausejour at the next election, I am happy to take the opportunity given me today to support the government's proposal and ensure that the Canadian Constitution will fully protect New Brunswick's French speaking community. This is a great day. I am pleased to support this motion and I take the opportunity to thank the people of Beausejour who have been so generous to me and my wife these last two years during which I represented them.

All these places, Cape Tormentine, Sackville, Dorchester, Memramcook up to Richibucto, are the best of Canada.
Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I support this motion.
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst:
That the question be now put.

Lome Nystrom (Yorkton-Melville):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SCHEDULE,AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA,"Madam Speaker, I too wish to say a few words on behalf of my party in support of the motion before the House today to amend the Constitution of Canada.
It is really a very rare day indeed in this country when we actually amend the Constitution of Canada. We have spent many hours and many years talking about constitutional reform, but today we are actually amending the Constitution and making this country a better place not just for the people in New Brunswick, but a better place for all of us regardless of where we live.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
I am very proud, on behalf of my party, to say that we support the amendment of the Constitution to enshrine in our constitutional law the equality of the linguistic communities of the anglophones and francophones in the province of New Brunswick.
I do that for two reasons. First of all, the process here is the right process and, second, because of the substance of what we are doing today in terms of New Brunswick. In terms of process, this amendment has come through a long and very open process in the province of New Brunswick.
I can remember years ago speaking with New Brunswick people about the process in that province toward the fight for linguistic equality of the two communities. Away back in July 1981 the New Brunswick legislature passed a law guaranteeing the equality of the two official language communities in that province. In 1982, in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, we had section 16 that guarantees the equality of the French and English languages in the province of New Brunswick, making it the only officially bilingual province in this country.
We can go on to 1989 and 1992 when two legislative committees in New Brunswick recommended further constitutional change after extensive public hearings in the province of New Brunswick.

This process has been going on for many years. Right here in this House, the language situation in the province of New Brunswick has already been studied.
I very well remember Mr. McKenna two years ago during the Meech Lake crisis. We also had a committee, chaired by the Minister of the Environment and the same proposal was in the Charest report. In June 1990, we also had a resolution in this House to change the Canadian Constitution for New Brunswick. The motion was already before the House then, but unfortunately it was not presented to the members.
I also remember the Beaudoin-Dobbie report very well. It was supported by every political party in Canada. We also supported the proposal on New Brunswick in the Beaudoin-Dobbie report. Later, we had the Charlottetown accord. Despite the result of the referendum on that accord, the Charlottetown proposal received very strong support in New Brunswick, both from anglophones and from francophones. If I remember correctly, over 60 per cent of the people in New Brunswick supported the Charlottetown agreement. Again, the New Brunswick proposal was included in this agreement, Madam Speaker. It was supported by the people, by the provincial government members and by the members from the three major parties represented in this House.
On Friday, December 4, the resolution was introduced and adopted by the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in Fredericton. It was supported by the McKenna Liberal Party, by the Conservative Party as well as by the hon. member and leader of the other party at the Legislative Assembly, Elizabeth Weir.
I would like to say a few words about Mr. Hatfield. He was the premier of that province for many years and he fought hard for linguistic equality in New Brunswick. He has accomplished many positive things for the Acadians as well as for the other people of the province.
I can also remember another former premier, Mr. Robichaud, a Liberal premier, who has done exactly the same thing for New Brunswick. The other party has always been quite small in that province, but nonetheless present, as exemplified by Elizabeth Weir last week, at the Legislative Assembly.

For all kinds of reasons of process what we are doing today is the right thing. This has been studied by people in New Brunswick, by committees in that province and by federal committees for the last number of years. It has been before the House previously. It was part of the companion resolution of Mr. McKenna back in 1990. It was part of the Charest report and part of the Beaudoin-Dobbie report. It was supported by all political parties as the right and proper thing to do.
Last Friday the legislature passed it, supported by the three national parties in the province of New Brunswick. They have now asked the federal Parliament, the Senate and the House of Commons, to pass the resolution as
December 11, 1992

required under section 43 of our Constitution Act to make this an amendment to the Constitution of Canada.
The process has been open, consultative and supported by the people and the legislature of the province of New Brunswick. Of course the resolution applies only to the province of New Brunswick.
The second point I would like to make on why we should be supporting this today is its substance. It is right and just to make sure we have equality between the two linguistic communities in that province. It is an act of generosity, an act of tolerance, an act that reflects our history that we have in this country as a whole two linguistic communities.
New Brunswick is really a microcosm of Canada. One-third of New Brunswickers are francophones and about two-thirds are anglophones. In order for the community to survive and thrive, the equality of those two communities should be enshrined in our Constitution. Our party has always supported minority language rights, openness, generosity and tolerance when it comes to the two languages in this country. I am very proud to be supporting this amendment to the Constitution of Canada on behalf of our party.
I want to conclude by briefly making a couple of more points. The first is that we are doing this in the proper way. In 1981 we had about four or five ways agreed upon at that time on how to amend our Constitution. One way was through unanimous consent for about five different items. The major way was with the support of two-thirds of the provinces, with 50 per cent of the population residing in the province and with the support of Parliament. That was the bulk of the amendments to our Constitution. That was the bulk of Charlottetown.
The third way was a bilateral way where the amendment affects one or more provinces but not all provinces. It had to be passed by the legislatures of those provinces and by the Parliament of Canada, under section 43 of the Constitution of Canada. It is interesting that section 43(b) also refers directly to language issues. It states: ""Any amendment to any provision that relates to the use of the English or French language within a province"".
What we are doing here is precisely what is called for in terms of the Constitution of Canada as patriated by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
Government Orders
That leads me to my last two points. There is a concern by some people that maybe what we are doing here is introducing something new called collective rights. I just want to say that line of thinking is absolutely wrong. We already have in our Constitution many times references to collective rights of people, linguistic rights in terms of the French language and English language all across this country. We have in section 16 of the Constitution the listing of those rights. We also have in section 23 guarantees for official language minorities. Be they English in Quebec for education or the francophones outside Quebec for education, those are collective rights. They are already in the Constitution of Canada.
In addition to linguistic rights and educational rights, we have rights for the aboriginal people that are already part of the Constitution of this country. In addition to that we have rights in Canada for people who come from many different multicultural and multiracial backgrounds. I suppose we could even say that under section 36 we have certain economic obligations of the federal government to provide equalization and regional development plans to help poor provinces, and again that helps collectivities in the poorer parts of the country.
Any challenge to what we are doing today is a very shallow challenge. It reflects people who go back to the 19th century and think the only rights that are important are individual rights. That is a very reactionary thing of the past and something we should be turning down as Canadians. This is a very positive, progressive amendment to the Constitution. It is in sync with what we have done before. It is an extension of what we have done before.
The last point I want to make before I sit down is that I do sometimes worry about the future of this country. I want to say at this time I know that the minister himself worries about the future of this country. The Minister Responsible for the Constitutional Affairs has done many months of very fine work in trying to build a national consensus. It is not just the minister; indeed many people in this House and many of the provincial political leaders across the country have worked hard. That consensus did not achieve fruition. We saw the results of the October 26 referendum.

Government Orders
Despite that, despite the fact that I sometimes worry about the future of this country, I think that within Canada and all regions of this country there is a great feeling that we must keep this country together. There is a great feeling that we must find ways of reforming our institutions, making this institution more meaningful, binding our country together and expressing that tolerance and that generosity to keep the country together as we move on to the 21st century.
I am optimistic about the future of Canada. I think this country is going to work. The gesture of today is a very concrete step in making this country better not only for the Acadian minority, not only for New Brunswick, but for all Canadians regardless of where we may live.

The two official language communities of New Brunswick have shown great understanding and generosity, and it is this spirit of liberality and magnanimity that allows us today to enshrine in our Constitution this principle of equality which is so important for our people's harmonious development.
For the Acadian community in my province, the recognition of these rights is the result of a very long struggle. A century ago, the Acadian people gave themselves a few emblems to rally around such as a flag, an
anthem and a national day. From these symbolic actions emerged a defensive nationalism, whose first priority is to preserve their language, culture and religion. Eventually they established ways to develop their economy, such as the Acadian co-operative movement, to ensure that the survivors of Grand-Pre would continue to survive.
Rapid progress was made when Louis Robichaud was elected as the first Acadian premier of New Brunswick in 1960. The University of Moncton was founded in 1963 and the Official Languages Act was proclaimed in 1969.
The equal opportunities program launched by Mr. Robichaud in the sixties has been essential to Acadians achieving recognition of the equal status they now enjoy with their English speaking neighbours.
Two figures who followed in the footsteps of Mr. Robichaud also deserve our recognition and gratitude, and I am referring to the late Richard Hatfield, who became premier in 1970, and the present premier, the Hon. Frank McKenna, who on Friday, December 4, led the legislature of my province in passing a resolution that recognizes the equal status of both official language communities of New Brunswick.
I want to thank my colleagues in the New Brunswick legislature whose co-operation made it possible for us to take part in this important event in Acadian history and in the history of New Brunswick and Canada. The support shown for Premier McKenna's resolution by the leader of the Conservative Party of New Brunswick, Dennis Cochrane, and by the members of his caucus, and the support of the leader of the New Democratic Party, Ms. Elizabeth Weir, is tangible proof that friendship and understanding between two official language communities are possible in this country.
I want to thank the Government of Canada, led by Prime Minister and seconded by the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria and Minister of Employment and Immigration for what they did today.
It is a great privilege to witness this historic day with the Leader of the Opposition who sponsored the enshrinement in the Constitution of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and who represents a large number of Acadians as the member for Beausejour in my province. A coincidence, I would say, that proves that luck is always on the side of those who persevere.
December 11, 1992

On this day, as we witness the end of a long struggle for harmony and the enhancement of both official language communities of New Brunswick, it is also appropriate to mention the many people who worked so hard, often without public recognition, that we might experience this historic moment.
I am thinking of Father Clement Cormier, Martin Legere, Raymond Gionet, Dr. Marcel Sormany, Dr. Alexandre Savoie, Antonine Maillet, Hedard Robi-chaud, Blanche Bourgeois, the nuns who worked with such dedication in Acadia, Gilbert Finn, Marie-Esther Robichaud, Michel Doucet, Michel Bastarache and many others who worked without respite for equal status for New Brunswick's Acadians.
Madam Speaker, need I add that these pioneers and passionate defenders of the cause acted in the best Acadian tradition by avoiding confrontation and fruitless debate, preferring instead the route of dialogue and compromise.

The English speaking majority in New Brunswick is made up of Canadians whose origins can be traced to many lands: Ireland, Scotland, India, England, Germany, Italy, Pakistan, the United States. The list is very long.
1 want to say today to my colleagues in this place that what makes so many of them so very special is that they share a tradition of generosity of spirit and a commitment to fairness and equity that makes me extremely proud to be a New Brunswicker.

This day will remain engraved forever in the collective memory of Acadians as the conclusion of one of the longest battles ever fought by a Canadian minority, determined to contribute in a positive way to the development of its province and its country.
This is a solemn moment, and all those who helped write this chapter in our history deserve our admiration, gratitude and respect. In concluding, I want to say this is a great day for Acadia, and I hope that the example set by New Brunswick's two official language minorities will be followed by others across Canada.
Christmas has come early this year for Acadians, and speaking on behalf of my colleagues-the hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur, the hon. member for Monc-

As members of the Bloc Quebecois, we are extremely pleased to endorse this motion. However, I would like to make some comments.
We did not have a chance to examine it more closely and I wonder whether the Meech Lake accord would pass as quickly if it came back to the House today. The Meech Lake accord let Quebec return to the Canadian Constitution upright and not on its knees. I wonder if the other Canadian provinces would have the courage New Brunswick has in recognizing duality and the founding peoples. I take Ontario for example. It is making slow progress, but should follow New Brunswick's example. Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the other provinces should imitate Quebec, for all purposes. But no, that was not done. Furthermore, it was confirmed in the massive rejection of the Charlottetown accord throughout Canada. Not only Quebec voted against the Charlottetown accord, but many other provinces of Canada, like British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Nova Scotia; the Toronto region voted yes, but when the outlying regions are included, 50 per cent of Ontarians voted against the Charlottetown accord.
We will support this motion because the Bloc Quebecois would not want to prevent Canada from developing as Canadians want. At the same time, we are showing this House again today that Quebec is being prevented from developing as it wants.
Just a few weeks ago, when the House returned, the minister who tabled this motion, supported by the Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs, told us, in answer to a request from the Bloc Quebecois to transfer occupational training to Quebec, that the Government of Quebec's requests could not be granted because the people had voted against the Charlottetown accord. Today these same ministers are tabling this motion and asking the House to agree to pass it on first, second and third reading in the same day, which we will do.

In conclusion, I say that this country, Canada, divided as it might be, is never divided because of Quebec. We in Quebec want the rest of Canada to develop as Canadians want, as long as they let Quebec develop as the people of Quebec want and agree to that.

I was most disappointed, however, that the legislation failed to explicitly define what constituted a family relationship. I am also disappointed that it did not state categorically that spousal benefits were exclusively available to heterosexual families.
I am also troubled that the legislation merely added sexual discrimination to the long list of personal attributes which we do not discriminate against rather than state quite plainly that we do not discriminate against people based on their personal attributes, whatever those attributes may be.
In short, the legislation lacks definition where it needs it and it has too much definition where it does not. I call upon the Minister of Justice to review these amendments to ensure that they do two things. First, they effectively protect all Canadians from discrimination and, second, they strengthen, define and support Canadian families whose existence is the very foundation of our country and the basis for its continued existence.

The past year, the 40th year of the Queen's reign, has been an exceedingly trying and stressful one for her, but through it all she has continued to personify and to demonstrate the finest qualities of the human spirit, qualities which are best demonstrated at times of adversity.
As each of us has our own personal problems and difficulties, times of trouble bring us together. It is at times like this that we can truly appreciate what the Queen symbolizes to us and how exceedingly well she fulfils her role and her responsibilities.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with her. God save the Queen.

It will ease the financial situation for many people, but it excludes some people who really ought to have been included.
For example, seven fishermen at Lord's Cove will not qualify despite their long attachment with the fishery running from 12 years to as much as 46 years. At Rose Blanche, long-time fishermen do not qualify. At Red Harbour, Burnt Islands, Point May, many communities, many fishermen in my riding, many plant workers are also unfairly left out.
There is no argument that the program does what it sets out to do. It eases the pain. I applaud the minister for that, but he must now realize that some people who ought to have been included have unfairly been falling through the cracks.

In the last six years its members have fought tirelessly on behalf of rural Canada. Rural Dignity has helped to draw attention to the issues affecting rural Canada. Whether it has been the closure of rural post offices, the loss of VIA Rail services or cuts to health care in rural areas, Rural Dignity has been there. Equally important has been Rural Dignity's ability to make people aware of the seriousness of the problems facing rural Canada.
Today most Canadians and even some politicians realize that if we do not act soon many of our rural communities will not survive. Increasingly people in rural communities across Canada have made it clear that they are not going to let their communities be shut down without a fight.
Today the people of St. Clement, Quebec, are occupying their post office to prevent Canada Post from shutting it down. In my own constituency of Moose Jaw-Lake Centre the people of Shamrock are working to force Canada Post to respect the wishes of the community and keep the post office open.
The renewed determination of Canadians in rural areas who fight for the survival of rural Canada is due in no small part to the work of Rural Dignity.

First, the existing Point Lepreau nuclear reactor is rated as one of the best operating units in the entire world and New Brunswick's nuclear management capability is highly regarded as the right environment for carrying out the construction of the Candu III prototype.
Second, the future potential for modular construction and sale of Candu III units world-wide offers New Brunswick an unprecedented economic horizon that would be difficult to match in any other way.

Unfortunately the provincial government in New Brunswick has apparently not been satisfied during negotiations that acceptable costs and guarantee provisions have been forthcoming and has been unwilling to consummate an agreement with AECL and the federal government.
Without question, in my view, New Brunswick is now on the verge of missing a compelling opportunity. I call on my colleagues in both the federal and provincial governments to make extraordinary efforts to salvage these nuclear power negotiations between them.

Citizens of the world know-certainly the Government of Canada must know-that Canada will be known internationally by its actions, not its rhetoric.
CIDA's current development assistance decisions in Colombia are one current example of government wrong-headed human rights and indigenous policy.

Chemainus is recognized internationally as the Mural Capital of the World. The town and its citizens combine history, culture and the arts to save what could have become a ghost town.
Chemainus, like so many small communities, was a single industry town dependent on forestry. When the economy slowed and the industry began to change, Chemainus suffered.
This was a town that would not die. Instead, through the inspiration of Karl Schultz and others and the hard work of many, Chemainus was born again. Now, after 10 years, 32 murals and thousands of visitors, Chemainus is known as the little town that did.
Its Festival of Murals Society has gone on to help other communities start mural projects of their own in Steubenville, Ohio; Bowenshire, Queensland, Australia; and Welland, the mural capital of Ontario.

Certainly there are difficulties. The impact of the economic slowdown has had an effect on all Canadians.
I remind the hon. member that federal spending on social programs which really address some of the difficult programs that he referred to has increased. Spending by the federal government between the period 1984-85 and 1991-92 increased from $44.6 billion to $66.8 billion. That was an increase of 5.9 per cent, and that was per year, when program spending was averaging at a growth rate of about 4 per cent on an annual basis.
In terms of the incidence of low income, 1984 to 1990, the 1984 figures had a percentage of 18.1 per cent. In
1990	it was down to 14.6 per cent. It went up a little bit in
1991	to 16 per cent, reflecting again the economic slowdown, but conditions are better today than they were in 1984 when we assumed office.

I want to go back to the minister in a slightly different way. There has been a question about the relationship between Transport Canada and Nationair. The chief of air carrier operations for region 7, an individual who was part of the pre-Jeddah audit of Nationair, who also wrote the glowing report on Nationair's safety during the lockout situation, has been seconded this fall by Transport Canada to work for Nationair as part of an executive exchange program for up to three years.
In light of this, I would ask the minister once again, will he not only launch an inquiry into the safety aspects of Nationair, in particular the Jeddah crash, but will he also conduct an inquiry into the relationship between Nationair and Transport Canada?

Regarding the employee in question, the hon. member said he was taking part in on ongoing exchange program between government and the private sector. This employee, who is experienced in transportation, will go and work for Nationair, and a Nationair employee could come and work for the government of Canada.

On her behalf I am now announcing the government's decision about Canada's participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cyprus.
After extensive consultations with the United Nations, Greece, Turkey, as well as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the government has informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that Canada will withdraw its troops from Cyprus beginning June of 1993, the withdrawal to be completed by September.
For the past 28 years, from the very beginning of the UN peacekeeping operation in Cyprus, thousands of Canadian men and women have displayed extraordinary competence, fairness and calm under pressure in the cause of peace. Their presence in Cyprus has been a powerful symbol of Canada's commitment to peace and security in the world. It has been a source of honour and pride, not only for those serving there but for all Canadians.
I am sure I speak for all members of the House and for all Canadians when I say that these Canadian men and women, as well as their families, are those to whom Canada owes a large debt of gratitude for their dedication and their professionalism, and to the 24 who died in the service of peace for their sacrifice.
December li, 1992

Beyond our contribution of troops and equipment, Canada has spared no effort to help the Secretary-General find a peaceful solution to this dispute. As recently as this year, the Secretary of State for External Affairs visited Cyprus, Greece and Turkey in May to press all parties concerned to work with the Secretary-General to that end.
She renewed our plea to Cypriots at the UN General Assembly in September and indicated that our patience was running short. We were deeply disappointed that the discussions under the Secretary-General's guidance have not been successful. In a unanimous resolution on November 25, the Security Council stated that the present status quo is not acceptable.
The government has also taken into account the report and appreciates the effort by a group of parliamentarians, led by the hon. member for Don Valley East, that provided the Secretary of State for External Affairs with useful information on the current situation in Cyprus.
After 28 years of service in Cyprus, after 28 years of watching both sides in the dispute being either unable or unwilling to negotiate a political solution, after 28 years of significant expenditures to maintain troops and equipment in that region without any measurable progress, it was time to face facts and come to certain conclusions.
Our experience in Cyprus has taught us many lessons.
One of the most important is that parties in a dispute must understand that there are limits to the duration of any peacekeeping operation. Peacekeeping must never be considered as an end in itself or as a substitute for political leadership, negotiation and honourable compromise. The basis for any peacekeeping operation has always been an agreement by the parties involved to work toward a political settlement. Whether or not Canadian troops remain in Cyprus, Greek and Turkish Cypriots bear the ultimate responsibility for resolving the dispute.
It appears that instead of taking advantage of the peace and order which the UN mission has afforded, some political leaders have used the presence of UN forces to avoid making the difficult choices, to avoid making the compromises required to ensure peaceful coexistence. At a time when there are increasing demands for peacekeeping around the world, we must
Routine Proceedings
ensure that we establish our priorities carefully and manage our resources and contributions effectively.
In deciding to withdraw our troops, we are not saying that the United Nations should put an end to its peacekeeping mission in Cyprus. That is a matter for the Security Council, the Secretary General and the parties involved to consider.
Furthermore, I assure the House that we will continue to support the Secretary-General's ongoing efforts to find a peacefully negotiated solution. In that regard, Canada once again calls upon the parties involved to implement Security Council resolution 789 and to work with the Secretary-General. If circumstances change, Canada would consider contributing directly to new UN efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Cyprus or to its implementation.
As the Secretary of State for External Affairs told the UN General Assembly last September, the Government of Canada endorses the Secretary-General's agenda for peace, in particular the peacemaking and peacekeeping themes of that document. That is why Canada will continue to play a leading role in international efforts to secure peace. We are turning a page in this particular chapter of our history. Our passion for peace remains as fervent as it was 30 years ago when our soldiers donned the blue beret and went to Cyprus.
With over 4,000 troops participating in peacekeeping missions from Cambodia to Bosnia, from Croatia to Central America and the Middle East, the words Canada and peacekeeping will always be closely associated in the eyes of Canadians and in the eyes of the world.

On behalf of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, I would like to express our gratitude, our appreciation, our heartfelt thanks to the thousands of men and women who act as our peacekeepers around the world. Their role is expanding now to peacemaking, to diplomacy. Returning from Cyprus, spending a lot of time with our peacekeepers there, I saw first hand what an outstanding

December 11, 1992
Routine Proceedings
reputation our Canadian UN troops establish for Cana- Commons so that we could debate it as our party has da-	been demanding for the last month? No.
The problem, as I said even on that visit there, is that they are doing too good of a job and the countries do not want to release them back to Canada. That is maybe part of the dilemma we are in.
I had the privilege with the hon. member for Don Valley East to establish the Canada-Cyprus parliamentary committee to look into the whole Cyprus situation because after 28 years Canadian taxpayers are saying that maybe it is time we brought our troops home. In that committee were members from the government side, the opposition side, my colleague for Kent joined me, the member for Outremont, the member for Don Valley East and a senator formed part of the fact-finding mission.
That committee made certain recommendations to the Secretary of State for External Affairs. If the Secretary of State for External Affairs and if the government will not listen to the Liberal recommendations, to the NDP recommendations, I thought that the Secretary of State for External Affairs would at least listen to her own members.
The committee made excellent recommendations. One was that the Government of Canada not withdraw from participation in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus until a replacement is found or a just and viable solution to the problem has been reached. I thought that was an excellent recommendation that the committee made to the government and had the government implemented it, I think everyone in Canada, in Cyprus, in Greece and in Turkey would have been happy.
Another recommendation made was that the Government of Canada seek additional funding to offset the costs of our peacekeeping force in Cyprus from those countries with a direct interest, including the Republic of Cyprus, Greece, the U.K. and the United States of America.
We heard from President Vassiliou himself that the Republic of Cyprus would be willing to increase its share of the peacekeeping cost. However, did the secretary of state negotiate that before making her decision? No. Did the secretary of state bring the issue to this House of
Has the secretary of state gone to the Standing Committee on External Affairs and International Trade and said to the committee that this is a very important issue for Canada and for peacekeeping around the world, please investigate and make recommendations to the government? No. The minister made her decision and then notified the standing committee and then notified us without consulting Canadians through this Chamber.
Another excellent recommendation was that the Government of Canada should do its utmost through the UN to bring about a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem as quickly as possible. We were also pushing for the solution to be brought about as quickly as possible.
However, the secretary of state, as usual, went on her own way without any diplomacy, without any consultation of the Canadian people, without bringing it to debate in this House.
I do not think the secretary of state is fair to Canadians. In the statement read by the Associate Minister of National Defence she did not point out the serious situation that exists in Cyprus today. On the northern side, Turkey has 35,000 troops, and that is in addition to the Turkish Cypriot army.
The Greek Cypriot side is spending $1 million a day on purchasing military equipment. If the UN peacekeeping forces pull out of the buffer zone, what is going to happen? I am quite sure that some of the 35,000 Turkish troops will start occupying the buffer zone.
Is the Greek Cypriot side going to stand for that? No. It is going to make sure that there are some forces brought to the green line, to the buffer zone to counter that move. Without the UN forces to negotiate disputes-it is not going to be a full-fledged war from day one-there will be little incidents between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots or between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish army which will fester like a wound and then blow up into a full-scale war.
There is a lot of cost on the part of Canadian taxpayers and those of other countries. However, which is cheaper? A full-fledged war between Turkey and Greece, or keeping our peacekeepers there until such time-and
December 11, 1992

that is all the opposition is asking-that a just and viable solution is found.
I mentioned in my question in Question Period today that President Vassiliou and Mr. Denktash had negotiations all summer. The talks did not break down completely. The talks were suspended because there is a presidential election in February. Both sides agreed, together with the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that these talks will resume in March under the careful guidance of the Secretary-General himself.
Why not wait to withdraw until a solution is found? A solution is around the corner. Why not wait until such time that another country will help us and send some peacekeeping troops in there? Unfortunately our secretary of slate blew it again. I wish I could have congratulated her in the spirit of Christmas, but no, our image in the international community is suffering. The secretary of state does not bring such important issues, where our military is involved, to be debated in this House first.

I can actually find reason to congratulate the minister. We on this side, certainly our party, do appreciate that the minister has chosen to make this announcement in the House of Commons. It demonstrates that the government or at least the minister can learn rapidly. A week ago the Secretary of State for External Affairs chose to make the announcement on Somalia downstairs in a press conference while the House was in session. I want to say that we appreciate that the minister has made the announcement here in the House today.
The next step for the government is to decide that important decisions of this kind will actually be brought to the House with a resolution in order that the House can pass judgment and can debate the issue before the government simply announces it. However, we appreciate the rate of learning demonstrated by this minister in the last week.
Canada has contributed to UN peacekeeping in Cyprus since 1974. Thousands of Canadian service personnel have served in Cyprus since that time. Thousands of families have made the sacrifice of separation in order that Canadians can participate in keeping the peace in
Routine Proceedings
Cyprus. Twenty-one Canadian Forces personnel died in Cyprus in the service of their country and in the service of the United Nations and we honour their sacrifice and their commitment.
I should take this opportunity to note the fact that many Canadian veterans of UN peacekeeping operations are disappointed that the Canadian government has so far failed to strike a Canadian service medal for peacekeeping under the United Nations in recognition of that service. The Canadian Peacekeepers Veterans Association, headed by James MacMillan-Murphy in my riding, has taken up this issue and I hope the government will respond to it.
The minister has today announced that Canada is withdrawing its forces from the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. It has done so with no replacement indicated. It has done so with no resolution of the dispute that took Canada and the United nations into Cyprus and it has done so with no assurance that this withdrawal will not make the situation worse. The government has said that UN peacekeeping is part of the problem. I submit that is simply wrong and that there is no evidence for that statement. UN peacekeeping is what is maintaining peace and security for the people of Cyprus.
The parliamentary committee to which my friend from Parkdale-High Park referred gave that evidence this week to the House of Commons, an all-party committee. It spoke to Cypriots from all sides and said that the UN peacekeeping force is vital for peace and security in Cyprus. In the minister's announcement there was no item of evidence against that proposition.
I submit that what the government is doing here is pandering to a natural war weariness by Canadians of the contribution that has been made over these many years. I submit that it is incumbent upon the government to show leadership to Canadians on this difficult issue and to say that we are performing a vital role and we must keep it up until either our forces are replaced with others or until there is a just and honourable solution to the dispute. As long as we are providing a useful service, we should stay in Cyprus.
We oppose this resolution because all parties say our contribution is vital to peace. We say that this announcement comes at a particularly delicate time while there are initiatives to try to resolve this dispute. There will be an election in Cyprus in February. The peace discussions

have been adjourned until March and I think the government has a duty to those from Canada who have sacrificed over the years in service in Cyprus not to come to this House until it can give assurance to the House and to the country that what we are doing is part of a solution and not simply an abandonment of responsibilities.
If we leave now or in 1993, as the government has announced, there is a real risk that the situation will blow up again and that all we are doing is saying, particularly to the Turkish side, wait long enough and our arms will again be able to impose our solution in Cyprus. That is wrong and it is a position that this government should have rejected.
It is said that this costs too much. It is said the government trots out the $14 million a year that this costs. As the member for Parkdale-High Park said, this is modest compared to the costs that may occur as a result of this decision.
It is modest to the billions of dollars that this government wastes in the Department of National Defence, including the latest outrage on helicopters.
I regret this decision. Our party regrets this decision and we hope the government will use the Christmas season to reconsider.

I am well acquainted with the Standing Orders, and I know that unfortunately, there can no further speeches by members.

I was elected in 1964 and we have had Canadians in Cyprus since 1964 and it so happens that I have been following the issue since 1964. Therefore, I very much regret that the rules of the House do not allow more participation because the rule is very clear: only the minister's statement plus two members, one from each parly, can speak. I am unable to participate, but I shall at the first opportunity since I sit on the committee on management of the House.
The very able chairman from Edmonton Southwest is here and I will certainly raise the issue at the first opportunity at the committee of management of the House that we may see the time has now come to change the rule which deprives a full debate, maybe at least an hour debate of some kind, with more participation from the House on very specific and important issues of international importance. I have a great deal of interest and Canada has a great deal of interest for its reputation.
Unfortunately, such is the rule, such is life. I want strongly to be on record that I very much regret that we are withdrawing at this time. We should have waited until at least March to know what would have taken place.

I would point out to the House that it contains close to 100 pages of amendments. It is an interim report and deals with the issue of who shall vote and how they shall vote. There are a few other items but that is the primary thrust of it.
The committee has engaged itself in close to 31 separate long meetings on the draft report alone because the work is so detailed in trying to provide for Canadians a better system of voting and protection against fraud at some kind of reasonable price.
The big change to enable Canadians who are away from their normal home to vote more easily under those conditions. That will include Canadians who are in some

other location temporarily within the country as well as Canadians who reside abroad.
Previous to this report, Canadians have had the opportunity, if they were in an embassy or the military, to vote. That is extended to others who have engagements outside the country for some limited period of time but still have their connection to Canada.
The report is far-reaching.
We are also anticipating as committee members that the government will produce a bill for us to consider immediately upon return in the new year so that these changes can be implemented in time for the next election. That is why we have done a report that contains what we believe to be the appropriate legal language to implement all of these provisions. That is the way we have done it. The drafting hopefully is done and will be checked by justice to make sure that we are all protected. We look forward to that.
I would like to pay a compliment to all members of the committee and the staff who have served us so well in difficult circumstances, and also to Elections Canada which have been so diligent in being of assistance to us in this very very detailed examination. It has been difficult, but we hope it was very worth while for Canadians and for our democracy. I commend it to all members, to read it in all its glory during the break.
We will also be sending it out to the 295 returning officers in Canada, and asking them to examine this detailed drafting and feed information back to us if they think we have gone astray.
They are very knowledgeable human beings. They have just been through the referendum and should be in a position to give us some good advice if they think we have done something, and recommended to this House something, that will not work.
This was a little longer than a normal introduction but I think the subject matter is of considerable importance and difficulty. Thank you again to all committee members and our staff.

provided mixed emotions for us. We experienced moments of pride and we experienced moments of sorrow in what we saw. We felt compassion and some helplessness during our visit. Perhaps this report will in some way help.
There are those whose housing was quite comparable to what we might consider to be an average southern community. They had an established economic base, a form of self-government, a relatively stable social environment and a good climate. We learned about them.
There were those settlements that had little of what I have just referred to. Yet despite it all they seemed to be determined to make their plight a better one despite the adversities confronting them. We learned about these people as well.
It is our sincere wish that this report accurately reflects what we heard, what we saw and what we felt. Our recommendations are intended to provide a path to resolve the housing problems that exist for our native Canadians in order that they may achieve suitable, adequate and affordable housing.
The committee and the chair, in particular, are greatly indebted to the clerk of the committee, whose camera seemed to appear everywhere and the results of her photographs will appear in the report, our Library of Parliament researcher, and the members of our own staff for their work and efforts in the research and writing of this report.
Most of all, I would like to extend the committee's most sincere and heartfelt thanks to those communities that opened their hearts and their homes to us. Their hospitality was beyond reproach and served as an example to the rest of Canada.
I want to thank the members of the committee whose dedication to this cause was beyond reproach. There were times when details seemed to attract the attention of some of the frustration of others. When all is said and done our report is better for their participation, and I want to thank them for their determination.

The government responded to this public pressure by passing the current gun control legislation. However, this legislation does not get to the root of the problem, which is the criminal misuse of deadly weapons. Instead the government's legislation restricted the legitimate recreational use of firearms without really tackling the need for stronger enforcement of regulatory control.
Since I could not support the government's legislation, I prepared this private member's bill to increase the penalties for those convicted of a firearm related offence.

The petitioners urge that Bill C-91 not be finalized. Further, they ask that Parliament repeal Bill C-22, passed in 1987, so that Canadians can have the full benefit from lower priced generic drugs.

3928545,ca.proc.d.1992-12-11.5.3.1.9,1992-12-11,1babc9d3-8d8a-489e-99f2-d360a5ab621b,ca.m.8020,Hon. Thomas Siddon (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):,Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,GWICH'IN LAND CLAIM SETTLEMENT ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Madam Chairman, I believe there is disposition on the part of the parties to make a short statement at the committee stage. Then if there are questions I would be prepared to take them.
I would like to very briefly outline the provisions of the Gwich'in Land Claim Settlement Act, Bill C-94.1 will, in the interest of time, keep this very short.
This bill will give the force of law of the Gwich'in comprehensive land claim agreement, of which I have a copy and which was tabled in this House on November 26. It is a historic agreement formally signed by the Governments of Canada, the Northwest Territories and the Gwich'in Tribal, council on April 22 of this year.
Under the terms of this accord the 2,200 Gwich'in people living in the Mackenzie River area, largely in the communities of Aklavik, Inuvik, Arctic Red River, and Fort McPherson, will receive title to more than 22,000 square kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories, and title to more than 1,550 square kilometres of their ancestral homelands in the Yukon Territory.
Bill C-94 also allows the Gwich'in to play a major role in managing the renewal resources of the area. It provides sub-surface rights to 6,100 kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories, and exclusive rights to certain commercial wildlife harvesting activities.
The financial benefits include a tax-free payment of $75 million in 1990 dollars to be paid out over the 15-year period following adoption of this bill. It also gives them an annual share of resource royalties at the level of 7.5 per cent on the first $2 million of resource earnings and 1.5 per cent on sums beyond that level of earnings as resources are extracted from the Gwich'in lands within the Mackenzie River Valley, and also a 15-year subsidy of property taxes on the undeveloped lands known as Gwich'in lands within municipal boundaries.
Under the terms of this bill federal, territorial, and municipal laws will continue to apply to the Gwich'in and their land until a self-government agreement has been successfully negotiated and brought forward to this House.
Those terms form the backbone of the land claim settlement, the backbone of Bill C-94, a bill whose merit all parties will acknowledge.
In every respect, this bill represents a great and historic step of progress. Bill C-94 provides the Gwich'in with a role in the development of the north. It does this through the creation of a number of specific management boards. It provides economic opportunities beyond their traditional vocations, a voice in the ongoing management of those resources, and provides for a dispute settlement mechanism to resolve disagreements which may arise with governments.
Let me just add that while the Gwich'in are exchanging certain undefined hunting, fishing and trapping rights contained in the existing Treaty 11 for the more clearly defined benefits of Bill C-94, all other treaty rights contained in Treaty 11, which was signed in 1921, will continue in place. These other treaty rights include the provision for annual treaty payments, education rights and other social treaty benefits.
The settlement of aboriginal land claims has been a major priority of this government. In recognition of the vital necessity to settle these land claim issues, necessary for the future of aboriginal peoples and the economic development of Canada, this government made the resolution of comprehensive claims the first pillar of the agenda of native initiatives which the Prime Minister presented in this House in September 1990.
Therefore, this legislation represents the first regional land claim settlement resulting from the prolonged negotiations with the Dene and Metis people of the western Arctic. In that regard the Gwich'in are truly pioneers. They have broken the ice and set an example for others in the western Arctic to follow.
In conclusion, I would like to personally compliment President Willard Hagen of the Gwich'in Tribal Council, Chief James Ross of the Fort McPherson Band and other members of their negotiating team and board for their very positive, optimistic, and confident approach to concluding this agreement.
Hon. colleagues, Madam Chairman, I would ask you to lend your support to the legislation before us today, which received a 94 per cent ratification vote from the eligible voting members of the Gwich'in nation last year. I call on members to facilitate quick passage. I do so especially because of the economic and human importance of this agreement to the Gwich'in people. I note that the Gwich'in elders will receive benefits before the Christmas period if this legislation is passed today.

I trust that hon. members will be prepared to give their consent to completing the passage of the bill through all stages today, including the final passage and referral to the other place. I encourage hon. members to give their complete co-operation to this important initiative.

I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak on this comprehensive land claim legislation. As the minister has mentioned, the Gwich'in people are the first to reach a regional land claim agreement in the Northwest Territories since the failure of the comprehensive Dene-Metis final agreement.
There are now two other native organizations in my riding of the Western Arctic, the Sahtu Tribal Council and the Dogrib Tribal Council, that have also initiated land claims negotiations based on the former comprehensive claim final agreement.
The Gwich'in people are very proud of their agreement, which is the final product of many years of very hard work and their tireless efforts to seek and achieve an agreement that would give them an immense opportunity for a financially secure future. The Gwich'in people are looking forward to using this agreement to better their lives.
As parliamentarians we can and are obligated to assist the Gwich'in people in obtaining this goal.
Negotiations have spanned seven generations of the Gwich'in people. Their struggle began in 1921 under Chief Julius Salu of the Tetlit Gwich'in and Paul Niditchi of the Gwich'a Gwich'in who were signatories to Treaty 11 on July 26 and July 28, 1921, respectively, in the communities of Arctic Red River and Fort McPherson.
The Gwich'in people had believed Treaty 11 could be a peace and friendship treaty until it was discovered that there was a misunderstanding in the translating of the treaty from the spoken word to the written page, with Ottawa interpreting the treaty as a surrender by the Gwich'in people of their lands and their cultural identity.
Government Orders
Their language, religion and traditional values which had survived for thousands of years were almost lost.
A strong and proud people, the Gwich'in have stood peacefully against those outside forces which sought economic wealth in taking their non-renewable resources and using their water and lands, some of which have sustained damage. They have survived against the wealthy and misguided anti-fur lobby groups which callously and dishonestly oppose the harvesting of fur and animal hides with precious little regard for the impact such deceitful and disrespectful campaigns have had upon the the Gwich'in, their values, traditions and their economic way of life.
It has been Gwich'in determination which has carried the Gwich'in people to this moment of the second reading of their legislation today. Theirs is an agreement which is the product of extensive negotiations conducted since the Government of Canada first accepted claims from the Dene and Metis in 1976 and 1977.
Using the 1990 agreement in principle as the basis for continuing negotiations, the Gwich'in of the Mackenzie Delta region and Canada began negotiations in December, 1990 and initialled a comprehensive agreement on July 13, 1991.
Special thanks and congratulations should be made to the people of the Gwich'in Nation who turned out to vote, as the minister mentioned, and to the support of the Gwich'in Clan between September 16 to 20, 1991. Of the 1,122 eligible voters, 1,021 cast a ballot and 960 voted in favour of the agreement; a very impressive 91 per cent turnout and a 94 per cent vote in favour of the agreement.
Appropriately, the historic signing of the Gwich'in comprehensive land claim agreement took place on April 22, 1992 at the Chief Julius School in the community of Fort McPherson. It should be noted that at that time there were many officials there, including territorial officials, the leader, the hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development as well as the member of Parliament for Western Arctic. Many respected elders who played an important role in the negotiation process were present and participated in the actual signing of the final agreement.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
The agreement is a celebration of the Gwich'in's culture and identity. After the signing, drum dances and fiddling dances and feasts were held in each of the communities of Fort McPherson, Aklavik, Inuvik and Arctic Red River, with the celebrations lasting for days. This agreement may not be the end of almost 20 years of negotiations or 70 years of struggle, but it is definitely a major step forward. The Gwich'in have negotiated a modern day treaty with more economic benefits, subsurface and surface ownership, regional powers in some cases, exclusive rights to hunting, trapping and fishing and clearly defined aboriginal rights. These provisions have been accepted and ratified by the majority of the Gwich'ins.
On the gains and provisions, the Gwich'in agreement represents significant gains for the Gwich'in people. They have within that particular agreement a flowthrough provision in section 3.1.5.
A general provision within the Gwich'in agreement protects the aboriginal identity of the Gwich'in people and within their legislation they are protected and included in the opportunity to benefit from or participate in any existing or future constitutional rights for aboriginal people which may also be applicable to them.
There is also the self-government framework in appendix B. The self-government framework agreement provides a broad range of aiiaiisjurisdictions over which the Gwich 'in may enter negotiation with the Government of Canada.
The framework agreement will allow the Gwich'in to discuss the transfer and delivery of programs, services such as education, training, language, revenue and taxation, health and social services and the administration of justice through a Gwich'in tribal justice system based upon traditional values. In years to come this aboriginal group will be recognized, its rights entrenched in the Constitution of Canada. There have been gains made from Treaty 11. Most Gwich'in Treaty 11 rights remain unaffected by the agreement.
On the question of land, the Gwich'in will receive title to 8,622 square miles of land in the Northwest Territories, including increased sub-surface rights and sub-surface resources, and an additional 600 square miles of land in the Yukon, which do not include sub-surface resources. They will receive $75 million over 15 years.
I urge the members of this House for speedy passage of this legislation in that there are specific provisions for
the elders to be affected immediately upon the passage of this legislation.
It also touches on the harvesting rights; many detailed rights in Gwich'in settlement area, including exclusive trapping of fur bearers, harvesting preferences on all species, exclusive harvesting on Gwich'in titled lands.
There is also the issue of expropriation. The quantum of land that was agreed upon in this land claims agreement is guaranteed to the Gwich'in forever. Even in the unlikely event that the government should need to expropriate a portion of land within the settlement area, this guarantee will stand.
Management rights and economic opportunities also exist. Gwich'in are guaranteed 50 per cent on management boards, including renewable resources, land use planning, environmental assessment, land and water regulation. The Gwich'in see this as a very positive gain which now gives the Gwich'in an equal say and a voice.
First time economic opportunities will now exist in a number of areas. They will have a role in development resolving disputes between government and Gwich'in and the amendments of the treaty. The Gwich'in believe that where no provisions existed before, now the Gwich'in have guaranteed consultation by developers on a variety of matters. There is an arbitration panel should there be a difference in interpretation of the agreement, and amendments may be made by agreement between the Government of Canada and the Gwich'in.
On the subject of future concerns and the implementation process, I would like to raise a concern which has been expressed to me by the Gwich'in. The Gwich'in are concerned over the lack of a benefits package for the Gwich'in when developers wish to explore for oil and gas on Gwich'in lands. In the Gwich'in settlement area this is an essential requirement for any First Nation that wants to promote and establish some form of self-government.
Another pressing concern is the existence of outstanding loans against the financial compensation package. The Gwich'in have taken responsibility for 15 per cent of the $40 million loan to the Dene Metis acquired when attempting to obtain a comprehensive land claims agreement. The Gwich'in believe that the Government of Canada has a fundamental obligation to provide claimant groups with the necessary funds to procure a comprehensive land claim agreement.
December 11, 1992

In the best interests of both parties and in good faith of the negotiation process, I hope and trust that the Government of Canada will respect the reasonable timeframe allotted to the establishment and commencement of the implementation plan and the implementation committee as well as provide the adequate necessary funding to put the structure of the agreement into place.
As the Liberal critic of aboriginal affairs and as a member of Parliament responsible for the constituents' concerns in Western Arctic, I will monitor the progress made with respect to the process put into place within a reasonable length of time of the settlement legislation passage.
I would like to take a brief moment to describe for the members of the House today the four communities of the Mackenzie Delta, Aklavik, Inivuk, Fort MacPherson and Arctic Red. Aklavik, meaning place of the barren land grizzly in Inuktitut, is a community of 760. These are the communities that have worked closely together to achieve this land claim legislation.
The community of Aklavik, which grew out of a small trading post established by the Hudson Bay Company, quickly became the chief trapping, trading and transportation centre of the muskrat-rich Mackenzie Delta. Aklavik is probably known by many of its inhabitants as the town that would not die. If you are from Aklavik you commonly use the phrase in a situation that is tough, ""never say die"". As the town was relocated by the federal government to Inuvik due to the serious flooding and erosion, despite these problems many residents remain in Aklavik today. Inuvik is the largest Canadian community north of the Arctic Circle. With a population of 3,200, it was the Northwest Territories' first modem planned town.
Fort McPherson is located on the edge of the Gwich'in Dene territory on the Dempster highway and was named after Hudson's Bay trader Murdoch McPherson. With a population of 729, it remains to be one of the north's most important economic areas for hunting and trapping.
The small community of Arctic Red River, with 125 residents, is located where the Arctic Red River meets
Government Orders
the Mackenzie and has been a seasonal fishing camp for the Dene for centuries.
I would like to take the opportunity in closing to pay tribute to the people who have worked on this particular land claims legislation. Do I have time? I do not. I will save the tributes and the closing comments for the next part of my speech.

3928547,ca.proc.d.1992-12-11.5.3.1.11,1992-12-11,a10911a7-55dd-4bb3-8f27-a1f6534327ed,ca.m.2500,Mr. Robert E. Skelly (Comox-Alberni):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,GWICH'IN LAND CLAIM SETTLEMENT ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues who made the initial presentations from the Conservative and Liberal parties. I want the House to know that our party is prepared to support this legislation through third reading.
We recognize that the Gwich'in claim was overwhelmingly ratified by the Gwich'in people. As mentioned by the member for Western Arctic, on September 21, 1991 when the ratification vote was taken, 94 per cent of the Gwich'in people supported this claim and therefore I think the House has to recognize that the choice has been made by the Gwich'in people and that they overwhelmingly support the agreement with the national government. Only 5 per cent opposed. I wish we had achieved something like that in our own referendum.
Our party has always supported the idea of aboriginal land claims, not only because they resolve some outstanding social problems and problems of injustice that Canada has experienced with its aboriginal people, but also they are capable of bringing a substantial boost to economic development. Our party supports the settlement of claims because we know that through the settlement of lands and resources and also the financial compensation and royalties along the lines that the minister mentioned, a great deal of capital and the opportunity for economic development will be returned to the north.
The past northern policies of Liberal and Conservative governments have resulted in a decapitalization of the north where non-northern companies go into the north-mine, log, fish, hunt, whatever they do-and take the resources out of the north. They take the capital out of the north, they take the income out of the north and leave people in a relatively poor situation, with aboriginal people being the poorest among the poor.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
This agreement has an opportunity to reverse that kind of decapitalization process. The people who live in the Arctic have been living there for approximately 9,000 years. It was their home in the past. It is going to be their home in the future. Any kind of capital or income that returns to their investments on their own lands is going to be reinvested in the north and we are going to see the kind of economic growth that we have not seen in those areas for a long time.
Land claim settlements should be a key part of the economic strategy of Canada. They certainly can reverse the decapitalization trend that has taken place in the past.
I want to let members know that we do have some concerns about the federal government's involvement in the negotiation process. As my colleague the member for Western Arctic pointed out, in the past the federal government insisted that the Dene Metis groups in the western Arctic get together and negotiate a comprehensive land claim that would cover the whole area. After the expenditure of a great deal of money, time, research and negotiations, they came to an agreement. When that agreement was presented at Dettah in July 1990 it was rejected by the vast majority of the Dene Metis people. At that point the Gwich'in people walked out of the meeting and indicated that they were prepared to make their own settlement.
One of the reasons they did that, as the minister of Indian affairs will know, was because they said that their people had been suffering long enough. The land claim was going to bring about compensation, it was going to give them a land base, it was going to give them certain administrative and government powers which they felt they needed in order to get their people on the process of development. They were able to get into separate negotiations with the federal government with that as their priority.
Unfortunately it is a bit of a form of blackmail that the federal government is able to use when dealing with aboriginal people. On the one hand, aboriginal policy of the national government keeps native people in a state of perpetual poverty; it deprives them of the resources they need in order to pursue their economic development; but, on the other hand, they may be forced to accept land claim agreements in which they are required to extinguish their existing aboriginal rights. That creates
a serious problem, a serious dilemma, for aboriginal people.
The Gwich'in felt they could negotiate a claim which would help them with their economic and social programs, which would move them ahead as a people, and yet they were anticipating in the future that there would be some change on the part of the government, some change which would eliminate the blanket extinguishment provision or the right to extinguish aboriginal rights. They were taking a chance on the future in order to assist their people.
It is unfortunate that we still have, not necessarily the blanket extinguishment provision but the cede, lease and surrender kind of provision which still reduces aboriginal rights of people and requires them to surrender aboriginal rights when they enter into land claims.
Aboriginal people are the only people in this country who, in settling an outstanding grievance with the national government, are required to give up rights that have been assured to them under our Constitution. As far as I am concerned, it is unfair, it is a form of blackmail, and it should not be done.
I am pleased to see that there is another party in the House which has followed the lead of the New Democratic Party back in 1985 when we passed a resolution saying there should not be an extinguishment clause. Certainty it can be obtained by setting up forums through which native people can negotiate with the governments of Canada and the provinces, in order to make sure their rights are respected and their land and resource requirements are respected, given the changing circumstances.
We were also concerned, Madam Chairman, about the way third parties were consulted in the advancement of the Gwich'in land claim. We were concerned that, for example, 600 square miles of land became a part of the Gwich'in settlement in Yukon. The consultations that took place between the Government of Yukon and the federal government were not what we would call free and open and the parties were not considered equal in the process.
In fact, the federal government simply told the Government of Yukon that 600 square miles of the Yukon would become part of the Gwich'in settlement. In some cases that is more land than was received by groups of the Council of Yukon Indians during their settlement. They felt they were not being treated fairly and equitably in relation to the 600 square miles which was allocated as
December 11, 1992

part of the Gwich'in settlement. The minister may be able to respond to that.
With those concerns stated, we would like to pay tribute to all of those who were involved in the negotiating process. We think the result will be satisfactory to the Gwich'in people and will help them with their economic and social programs. It will make sure they can develop along the lines that they as a people in the Northwest Territories would like to develop. We wish them all the very best as a result of the outcome of this settlement.

Bill C-94 is a very important bill because it deals with aboriginal people. They have been neglected for so long that they merit more attention than we are giving them. This bill is presented here the same day as the House adjourns, and it has to pass through all stages.
I find it somewhat strange that the Department of Indian Affairs could not have introduced this bill a long time ago so that it would be debated on its merit. This leaves us very little time to do so.
As the Gwich'in people seem to be happy with this agreement, I am certainly supportive of this legislation. It is extremely important that the Gwich'in people be in accord with this legislation and as the minister and other members said, the people are in agreement.
However, I would like to mention something here. I have been to the north and I have seen the aboriginal people living in conditions that are so bad that the Third World countries would be ashamed of those conditions. Canada should put a priority on treating her own aboriginal people fairly. I do not think the federal government has done it in a proper way.
We have a huge Ministry of Indian Affairs consisting of almost 3,000 employees dealing day to day with this problem. They should have projects and situations that would improve the lives of the aboriginal people. If you go to the north, you see how appalling the situation is.
Government Orders
The aboriginal people cannot continue to live in such a way. It is late in the day and the minister brought this legislation in only half an hour ago but I would like to commend him for doing it. It is better late than never. I hope that he will take a lesson and deal with aboriginal affairs seriously and have other treaties signed to the satisfaction of the aboriginal people.
Therefore, I support the agreement and I congratulate the minister for bringing it in, even if it is late.

I think this is very important.
The minister had the opportunity to do that, and I appreciate it, but a double tribute is not going to hurt in this case since the treaty was so much work.
The prominent Gwich'in have worked for the Gwich'in cause over the last 71 years. Chief Julius Salu of the Tetlit Gwich'in and Paul Niditchi of the Gwich'in were signatories to Treaty 11 in 1921.
The late Chief John Tetlitchi of the Tetlit Gwich'in represented the Tetlit Gwich'in for many years as chief and as a member of the legislative council of the Northwest Territories.
These individuals are outstanding leaders in their communities and basically drove the process at a time when it was not deemed to be either fashionable or the thing to do. Chief Johnny Charlie of the Tetlit Gwich'in represented the Tetlit Gwich'in for 10 years as chief and still plays an active role within the Gwich'in nation. He is also a very active member of the community as well as of the region. He is respected by many Dene people throughout the Northwest Territories and many aboriginal and non-aboriginal people.
Willard Hagen, president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council has led the Gwich'in since they decided to proceed with a comprehensive land claims agreement with the Government of Canada.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
James Ross, Chief of the Tetlit Gwich'in, was instrumental in obtaining a Dene Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement on April 9, 1992, and later the Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. Chief Ross has served his community and his people in various capacities over the last 10 years. He has been very active within the region and within the Northwest Territories, and is recognized for his work. He is fiercely determined, a very proud man, very intelligent and very eloquent on issues that affect his people, as well as his region and the north in general.
The former leaders of the Gwich'in who deserve special recognition and praise are: Chief Hyacinthe Andre of Arctic Red River, the late Chief Johnny Kaye of Fort McPherson, Chief Andrew Stewart of Aklavik, Chief Grace Blake of Arctic Red River, David Krutko, a former negotiator of the Gwich'in claim and former vice-president of the Metis Nation of the Northwest Territories, Margaret Donovan, former vice-president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council, Fred Koe, former negotiator of the Gwich'in claim and currently the MLA for Inuvik in the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly, Richard Nerysoo, the MLA for the Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly, and newly appointed cabinet minister for the Government of the Northwest Territories, as well as having been a former Minister of Justice and a government leader of the Northwest Territories.
As well, I would like to commend and congratulate the current leadership of the Gwich'in Nation, without whose efforts the Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement might not have been realized:
Willard Hagen; James Firth, Chief of Inuvik and vice-president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council; Robert Alexie Jr., vice-president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council and former negotiator of the Gwich'in claim; Chief James Ross; Chief Eugene Pascal; Chief Peter Ross, Charlie Furlong, president of the Metis Local of Aklavik and former president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council; Morris Blake, president, Metis Local of Arctic Red River; Ernest Firth, president of the Metis Local, Fort McPherson; Tommy Wright, president, Metis Local, Inuvik.
In closing, I would like to say that we support the passage of Bill C-94. It is what the Gwich'in people want. There is a saying within that community and it reflects the history of the Gwich'in people.
During the celebrations and during the finalization of the comprehensive claim they passed out stickers, posters and sweat shirts, and on them it said something that speaks loudly for these people. All it says, as we have said many times about being Canadian, ""Proud to be Canadian"", many of those Gwich'in say ""Proud to be Gwich'in"".

As the minister knows very well, one of the more pressing considerations in the B.C. claims is obviously the fishery. There has been a considerable amount of discussion about impact evaluation, particularly independent impact evaluation in relation to the fishery. Certainly, part of that has been dealt with in this most recent negotiating process between the Government of Canada, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and the Gwich'in.

I would not necessarily undertake that in the case of British Columbia land claims we would create an entity to be called a renewable resource board. There will be in the context of British Columbia land claims, provision for a process of negotiating self-government which is provided for in the Gwich'in land claim agreement as a subsequent step but in the context of British Columbia First Nations may be part and parcel on a parallel track with the settlement of the land based issues. It would be premature to anticipate how those arrangements would work.
In the case of the Gwich'in agreement, the provision for a Renewable Resource Management Board is something that will take place immediately, subject to establishing the membership of that board.

However, due to an anomaly in the maps, when the boundary was drawn between Yukon and Northwest Territories, that area which was part of their traditional
Government Orders
hunting and trapping area was caught on the western side of the boundary.
The 600 square miles are not to be administered in the same way as those within the primary Gwich'in settlement area within the Northwest Territories. The wildlife or renewable resource management would be administered in a co-operative way with the surrounding First Nations in the Yukon and subject to arrangements that will be worked out with the government of the Yukon territory as well.
In particular, the interests and concerns of the people of NaCho Nyak Dun will be taken into account and there will be no question of the management boards provided for in this agreement having effect in that other 600 square mile territory, which I think if I am correct, falls under what we describe as a fee-simple type of arrangement subject to management structures being worked out with the existing public government, the government of the Yukon territory and in collaboration with the surrounding First Nations.

It does recognize its pre-eminent right to the harvesting of wildlife resources.
There are to be six members of the board, as I understand it: three from the government, non-aboriginal, and three from the Gwich'in nation, plus a chairman for a total of seven. The chairman is to be a resident in the settlement area, is to be nominated by members of the board and appointed jointly by the Governor in Council and executive council of the two governments.

Therefore, the presumption would be that if the chairperson is drawn from within the settlement area it would be a Gwich'in person. Then the Gwich'in would have the ultimate say in decisions taken by the management board but they would not be binding on the public government in terms of existing laws, unless those laws are changed through the negotiation of the self-government agreement which is provided for in this settlement act.

If we had constitutionally recognized inherent right of self-government with clear designated authorities residing with First Nation governments, as had been envisaged in the Charlottetown accord, there would be no question of the powers of those First Nation governments being in any way fettered by the powers of Parliament.
However, under our present system of law and given the supremacy of Parliament, this is the body which must implement laws with respect to the administration of all territories within Canada unless those laws fall within provincial constitutional jurisdiction or by delegation are exercised by territories or other levels of government.
Under the present system of law within Canada if the orders and regulations to give effect to this agreement are to be changed they must be changed by Governor in Council.
The question the hon. member asked was: Do the Gwich'in people consent to this arrangement? Yes, they do, and I am advised that clause 3.127 of the agreement provides that the agreement may be amended-this is why we would use Orders in Council-with the consent of Canada, the Gwich'in as represented by the Gwich'in Tribal Council and where the territorial government is affected, the Government of the Northwest Territories.
In other words, there is no question here of the Parliament of Canada usurping the authority and the recognition of Gwich'in prerogatives with respect to their territory. Their consent would be required.

This is fundamental and I cannot believe the advice of the Table to the Chair would allow this motion to be put.
Section 53(2) it says, if one takes the time to read it, that the minister in proposing the motion has to state reasons for the urgency of such a motion and then the Speaker shall propose the question to the House. There was not a reason mentioned in the minister's motion about why this is an urgent motion.
My point goes much further to say that the motion is also fundamentally defective because this talks about notice and/or days and sittings. There was a notice about where we are in this procedural problem. The point is that this is a national urgent matter that I think has only been used once before and ironically I think it was in the peacekeeping of Cyprus 20 some years ago. The fact of the matter is that this motion is for matters to be handled, not to try to remedy a problem the government finds itself in now by not observing the rules. This is for future events. My position is that this matter has been defined and it is no question of notice. It is no question of hours and days of sitting. It is a question that in effect we had a motion of the minister, as Your Honour says. That motion was put and the question was put. You were in the chair this morning, Madam Speaker, when the question was put. Five members rose to force a vote.
I want to see the ""blues"". I am sure Your Honour has seen the ""blues"" and the question was called. Five members rose and Your Honour said something. Most of the words I heard. Then there was a little confusion: ""That pursuant to Standing Order so and so, the order to defer the vote until another time"".
There were some of us in this House who appreciated the problem the government might be in if the motion was put to a vote, we had a deferral, and in view of the Christmas recess this would give time for this motion to sit out there.
It is an amendment to the Constitution. Even yesterday the opposition House leader was talking to the government House leader in terms of the order of business and talking about notice.
We got on to something about other matters to be discussed. If this matter is so urgent how come there was not any previous notice? Even yesterday, in effect talking about what might come up, the opposition House leader at page 15049 said:
I thought that perhaps it was an innocent mistake -
Referring to the government House leader's outline of business.
-with regard to other business that may be raised tomorrow, particularly in view of what has transpired in other jurisdictions.
The inference was very clear of what happened in the legislature of New Brunswick.
There is no person here, and certainly not myself, who is reflecting on what happened in the province of New Brunswick. New Brunswick can look after itself and decide to pass its own laws as it already has.
What some members have forgotten is that this is the Parliament of Canada, not the legislature of New Brunswick. This motion has very serious implications. It certainly is a very important motion. It is an amendment to the Constitution.
There were many of us who were thinking of speaking this morning. However, knowing the rules and knowing you cannot roll back the clock, even if this is Friday and knowing we cannot have another Black Friday in this House, we knew that if the vote was put the matter would be deferred. Let it be deferred if it is an important matter so that there can be reflection across the country. Some of us by this procedure of trying to get back into it, having had the vote, in effect are precluded from now

I know the position he is in.
As the Chair knows, this legislation enables Nova Scotia to proceed with reorganizing and streamlining the court system, merging the County Court and the Supreme Court trial division into one court, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. That has been done in most parts of the country, so we will support the bill.
The Supreme Court appeal division will now be constituted as a separate court, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. That is like in British Columbia, where we have the Supreme Court of British Columbia and then the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. It is a housekeeping bill, removing references to the County Court and the judges' salaries associated with that institution.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
I just want to point out to the parliamentary secretary that the drafters of this legislation took the time to include clauses which remove sexist language from the drafting, I think for the first time. For example, subclause 33(1) reads ""of the province concerned of the judge's election as provided'' where the original read ""of the province concerned of his election as provided''. Of course, we have a lot more women judges.
That is one of the matters I wanted to ask about. In the Nova Scotia legislature there was a bill, Bill 241, the Court Reform Act, which was passed this spring in the Nova Scotia legislature. Speaking for the New Democrats, John Holm, called the bill ""by and large a tremendous move forward"". He noted that ""certainly we will be supporting it"". Therefore, if it is good enough for Mr. Holm, it is good enough for me in this instance.
I read the Nova Scotia debates with care. Miss Sandra Jolly, who is the member from Dartmouth, raised a number of interesting matters.
She raised the matter of other recommendations that were being put forward with the Nova Scotia bill, a recommendation that judges, lawyers, police, prosecutors and court staff should receive regular supervised training to ensure that they understand the unique nature of domestic violence and to assure that they are kept abreast of developments in this area. In other words, so the court and the court officials know about domestic violence and what that means because so many of these cases are coming before the courts.
Another recommendation that was made in Nova Scotia was that the Government of Nova Scotia should, in relation to family violence, promote and encourage more effective needs, assessments and planning, better service co-ordination, stronger client advocacy, public and professional education, preventive strategies in the development of a treatment program for batterers, mainly wife batterers.
A third recommendation that was mentioned by the hon. member in Nova Scotia was mandatory gender sensitive training for judges.
Does this bill deal with any of these matters and if not, why not? Is the government doing to deal with these very
legitimate questions that were raised in the Nova Scotia legislature?

In relation to the gender of language raised by the member this government has now appointed over 100 women to the bench in Canada. We were proud in Alberta that the new Chief Justice of Alberta, Catherine Fraser, was the 100th appointed by this government.

I did not fully appreciate that it was going to be on the Door of the House today, although I must say that I now see it is on the Notice Paper for today.
I was interested in the questions put by the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam who is the NDP justice critic. He has certainly maintained a consistent interest in this field. I was also interested in the parliamentary secretary's answer. I certainly agree with the parliamentary secretary that the government has moved eons in appointing women to the judicial role.
Just recently, one of the last appointments-and it was not the person the parliamentary secretary mentioned- but it was certainly a former friend of mine in the sense that she was a resident of the Annapolis Valley. She was a county court judge and family court judge and has become one of the more recent Supreme Court judges in Nova Scotia.

It is not the gender question, per se. It is a question of the single parents. Of course, in most cases it is usually the woman looking for support from the absconding male. This is very serious.
I can think of many situations but obviously I am not going to mention names. There are a number of single parents who have gone through the family court process involving the county court judge. They have gone through long hearings and often, the male does not show up. The legal bills have been astronomical. I can think of one person in the heart of my riding who for a total of
Government Orders
about $800 in family support payments has run up a legal bill of over $26,000 with a firm that I know very well.
After having heard all these facts for and unfortunately knowing some of the players, I seriously considered writing or taking some action to ask the judicial system of Nova Scotia why this was happening. Why did the judge in charge render decisions and keep delaying and let the defaulter continue to default?
I tried to quickly look through the bill when it first hit the floor. Is there anything in this bill whereby the parent can write to a judicial committee of the court setting out the facts that they think they have not been treated fairly. Maybe they could also complain about legal bills and perhaps have some redress. Is that redress separate and apart from the judicial system?

The requirements he was asking about are really beyond the scope of this bill. This bill is neither major nor complex. Its provisions are essentially technical.
What we are doing here is to substantially affect the functioning of the legal system in Nova Scotia by making necessary amendments to federal law to permit the court restructuring in the province of Nova Scotia. That is essentially what we are doing with this bill. It is essentially a technical bill to allow the province of Nova Scotia to restructure its court.
Mr David Dingwall (Cape Breton -East Richmond):
Madam Chairman, very briefly to the parliamentary secretary. I must say he is doing an admirable job in responding to the many and varied concerns on the subject matter before us.
We understand there are now 33 Superior Court judges in the province of Nova Scotia. Perhaps he might want to indicate the annual salary range for those judges.
We note that retirement is at age 70. Is that a reduction from the previous high of 75 down to 70? I presume that corresponds to the provincial legislation in Nova Scotia.
Regarding the sensitivity that judges display in their respective courts, my colleague from the New Democratic Party raised a number of concerns which had been placed on the floor of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly by the Liberal critic from Dartmouth.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
One was with regard to sensitivity that judges have or should have in their courtrooms. I wonder whether it is the desire of the Government of Canada to come forward with subsequent legislation in terms of mandatory training for judges on gender sensitivity as well as the whole issue of family violence, which is becoming more prevalent as time goes on.
That concludes all of the questions I have regarding this particular bill. Perhaps I may put in a supplementary for my dear friend and colleague from Annapolis Valley-Hants. The parliamentary secretary could indicate to our colleague, who is a distinguished member of the bar of the province of Nova Scotia, whether or not there are any vacancies available at the present time.

First let me deal with the question on the training of judges. Yes, obviously we are very concerned about the reasons for the question and the discussion in the country today. The government, as I said, takes cognizance of all such reports.
If I could just get the attention of the member for Annapolis Valley-Hants, an ordinary judge would make $155,800. The retirement age is set for the Superior Court at age 75 and County Court judges 70 until it is raised by this legislation.
Just to clarify this, apparently in 1975 the retirement age of judges was raised from 70 to 75. This bill will take it back to 70 but it simply grandfathers those who were on the bench subsequent to 1975.

Is there any process to appoint judges not just by the whim of the Prime Minister or Order in Council? Those judges should be screened and have some training as well.
What bothers me as well as the very high salaries is it is also my understanding that some judges have limousines given to them. Maybe not in Nova Scotia, but in certain provinces they have limousines given to them. Could he' inform us on that?
What happens to the judge who is 69 or 70 and just marries? I know of one case in which a young lady married a judge because his wife died, and she was about 22.

First, I should tell the member that the Minister of Justice actually rejected gender sensitivity training. The government rejected that because the minister considers it to be interfering with the judiciary. Other people have different views on that question.
However, I raised the matter of getting more women on the bench and he responded. He said a lot of women were appointed. He is from Alberta. The last appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada was Mr. Justice William Stevenson, who has written about four judgments and who is a man. I am sorry, he was second last. There was William Stevenson and then John Major, who is another man.
The Minister of Justice said that they had approached and offered the job to several outstanding female judges, but they turned it down. There is a problem in getting women judges.
The Vancouver Sun wrote an editorial on November 26 saying:
If the federal government recognizes there is a problem -and
there is one when only two of the court's nine judges are women -
That is, in the Supreme Court of Canada. Often women come up through the courts from Nova Scotia or British Columbia, for example, to the Supreme Court of Canada.
The editorial continued:
- it should be working to find a solution. There is no simple answer, but one thing it might consider is the requirement that Supreme Court judges live in Ottawa.
And what about job sharing in the top court? It's a radical idea, but smaller case loads and the ability to remain based in their home provinces might make more judges -male and female-consider a Supreme Court appointment.
In other words, it would not be a full-time job so that a woman could feel, if she has to spend time with her family, that the family will not be destroyed. More important, women will not feel that by taking one of these jobs they will put their family in jeopardy. That is a barrier that stands in the way of women being appointed to the court.

It is my understanding that with respect to jurisdictions, particularly with respect to federal appointments, an arrangement has been concluded with the Minister of Justice and the Canadian Bar Association, as well as the provincial attorneys general. There is now a new system in place with regard to how justices are appointed to Superior Court, some of them accept applications, with respect to the screening process et cetera.

We have sat here all day and have already passed a very important bill. With all respect to the junior inexperienced parliamentary secretary, for that parliamentary secretary to think that delay tactics have been used here to the extreme, he is, with all respect to the opposition House leader, more often in bed with the government on many things than on his own. He in effect does not understand what parliamentary opposition let alone obstruction is.
There has not been one tittle of obstruction on the very important bill of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development which went through this House and Committee of the Whole. That in itself opened up the whole question of self-government for aboriginals and the Charlottetown accord and we could have talked quite relevantly until the cows came home on that. There was circumspection and in effect relevance to the questions put and that bill got through.
The parliamentary secretary can say that in effect this is just a reorganization of the courts of Nova Scotia and the fact of the matter is it has something to do with the judicial system in Nova Scotia. That in itself opens up the whole question of the judicial system in Nova Scotia on which any member from Nova Scotia or any member from across the country could have an awful lot to say.
Let us not have disparaging remarks on legitimate questions that perhaps the parliamentary secretary may not agree with, but it is certainly nothing in terms of the rules of obstruction and parliamentary debate that prevents us moving ahead.
While I am still on my feet, I must say I do have more questions that I hope the parliamentary secretary will not take umbrage with. I frankly was absolutely amazed. I have not practised law for years and I know what the members of Parliament get. We get frozen and everyone gets frozen. I was on the phone in the lobby talking to some good people from Nova Scotia about what they thought about this bill. I hope to hear from them in the next two or three minutes so that I will have perhaps some more relevant questions that will ease the ear of the parliamentary secretary, rather than what I am going to say now.
December 11, 1992

I was very surprised. I heard the parliamentary secretary answer when I was on the phone. Did he say the judges as defined in this bill get $155,000? I point out to him a study that I have done. We in Canada in many areas are paid quite a bit and sometimes too much. I understand it from work done in my office, that compares with the Chief Justice of the United States of $166,200 U.S, but that is more than this judge. Supreme Court justices under the Supreme Court get $159,000 U.S; again that is the very top court.
Circuit court judges in the United States receive $137,300 U.S. District judges, which would be I guess like our former county court judges, get $129,500 U.S.
I do think if the answer of my friend the parliamentary secretary of $155,000, albeit Canadian, is correct for the judges created by this bill in the reorganized court, although some of my judge friends may not agree with this, they are very well paid.
Back to the question that even though the parliamentary secretary says this is a technical reconstruction of a court, I find it very difficult when you eliminate the county court and put them all into one court that you consider this just a technical change. Even with a technical change, does the parliamentary secretary to the government not think there is any merit in having some type of judicial committee that the citizen can write to, complaining about problems, somewhat like an ombudsman, for a citizen in the courts who feels that perhaps he has not been served properly or do they just have to come to members of Parliament or do they write to the Chief Justice?

With reference to the salaries, this bill does not deal with the salaries per se. It is simply levels the field across Canada and moves the county court. That is a figure that has been established across Canada for ordinary judges across the country. For the member's information, that amount has been frozen for the next two years.

As I read this amendment, that is periiaps the vehicle whereby a citizen can in effect register some question about the quality of the judicial service that that citizen received or was exposed to.
I would like to have a chance to put that question. I always thought, before we got into this bill, as I understand some other aspects of law, that there was some judicial committee. It may be composed of the Chief Justice. I think it may be an in-house committee with other judges. That is what I would like to ask about and to have it explained in view of the earlier answers.

I understand that, but because all these different statutes are mentioned I again point out to those who have not seen how a bill can sometimes be dragged out that it really opens up all those acts to say something if we really wanted to. We have not been doing what some people may think we are doing, although I must say the clock is an interesting feature of a debate.
I am very interested in the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act in several ways. This is not just amending the terminology of the judges to conform to the different acts that have already been named. This sets out an order of the board. As the parliamentary secretary may or may not remember, it was members when some of us were in government and in opposition. Certainly the member for Regina-Lumsden as a member of the transport committee spoke in the House on the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act. I do not know if that is the act because I do not have it before me. I think it is the act whereby merchant seamen finally got compensation after a long fight to be recognized. I would like to know that first.
It may be the Veterans Merchants Compensation Act. I am not sure, but I would like to know the reason for the amendment whereby it speaks of an order of the board for payment of compensation. What is the composition of that board, which seems to be a new feature, although it may not be? I just cannot understand why it is within the reorganization of the court system in Nova Scotia.

I will take my chances with my electors from Nova Scotia as much as any of my friends are taking their chances with their constituents too. Our duty is to ask questions. The government brought the bill into committee of the whole. It wanted to get something through the House quickly. If it had any procedural experience, it would have never have opened up Committee of the Whole.
We could have held the bill up if we had wanted to obstruct. If we wanted to delay, we could have held up a section, which I told you about before on the debate on the aboriginals. It would have been legitimate debate, opening up that whole area of concern of Canadians, let alone aboriginals.

However, because it was a very important bill, and the minister of Indian affairs controlled his exasperation, although he obviously was a little exasperated by questions from time to time, that bill got through.
We are now in a massive reconstruction, for the first time, of the court systems in Nova Scotia and we are sailing along. The parliamentary secretary of transport- not even the parliamentary secretary of justice or the justice minister-is answering the questions. That shows how much this government feels about the court administration in Nova Scotia. It has a junior parliamentary secretary here and it is not even his jurisdiction.
I do not have to take second place to the parliamentary secretary who is a fine person, an astute individual and is an experienced politician belying his youthful looks. The fact of the matter is that he is not the parliamentary secretary for justice and we have found out that in questions, he could not give simple answers.

I would just say in closing before I table my written remarks that I was prepared to make today, that this government seems to feel that it can start putting through bits and pieces of the Charlottetown accord on Fridays by using these procedural agreements. It is just putting things through when people aren't paying attention on the last day before Christmas holidays. It is attempting to use Standing Order 53 right now. It thinks it will be able to put Charlottetown accord through bit by bit. If the government learned nothing on October 26, it should be that it cannot do that. If it does it by using these standing orders, putting it through bit by bit, this place will just be a very sad place and this will be a very, very sad day.

I will table my remarks.

Private Members' Business
uses of technologies and skills used in the nuclear weapons industry, be read the second time and referred to a legislative committee in the Natural Resources envelope.
He said: Madam Speaker, I am very happy to have this opportunity to begin the debate on Bill C-274, which I tabled in the House in 1989.
It is an act to provide for the conversion to civilian uses of technologies and skills used in the nuclear weapons industry. Bill C-274 is to prepare for the ending of contracts for producing or handling nuclear weapons. It encourages the conversion of technologies of nuclear weapons work into the manufacturing of civilian goods. It helps workers who lose their jobs as a result of the change to find new jobs or it provides benefits to those who become jobless.
The bill requires a company with a nuclear weapons contract to set up a committee to help in changing the plant to civilian production and in retraining the workers. The committee will have equal numbers of representatives from the company and the workers and non-voting community members.
The nuclear weapons company must set up a fund to do all this, and must deposit in it 2.5 per cent of its gross revenues each year. The company and the committee are also to seek funds from other sources.
The bill gives the minister discretion to help the committees and the companies carry out this conversion and provides fines for those who contravene this act.
This bill is supported by two recommendations of a report made to Parliament in October 1992 by the Subcommittee on Arms Export of the Standing Committee on External Affairs and International Trade. That report recommended that Canada prohibit the export of components for nuclear weapons, and also that the government should help to establish a Canadian diversification and resource centre.
My colleague, the New Democrat member for Victoria, will further explain these recommendations later in this hour, as he was a member of that committee. However, I would like to present two strong reasons for converting from the making of nuclear weapons to the making of civilian goods.
First, nuclear weapons use up huge amounts of money, labour, scientific training and research. This is a terrible waste. Instead of these bombs and the missiles to deliver

Private Members' Business
them, we should be making such things as mass transit systems for our cities and instruments for detecting and cleaning up pollution, or we could be developing renewable energy resources that our country and the world badly need. With so much poverty in Canada and in the world we cannot afford to squander our best skills and our best materials.
Second, we already have tens of thousands of these mass killing machines stored in many places around the world, and under many governments. They terrify us, and with good reason. They have killed people already, not only in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but in other ways since then, more accidentally, and they have been used to threaten people.
If they are used again they might end all human life. Enough. Let us learn to work to get rid of them, not to make more. We cannot rely on the arms manufacturers by themselves to switch from making killing machines to making things useful for life because arms manufacturing is very profitable.
The arms makers' association that used to mount an annual sales blitz in March in Ottawa called ARMX is now advertising the same weapons to the same international buyers under the slick title of Peacekeeping '93.
Most people do not know to what extent Canada is engaged in producing nuclear weapons systems-vehicles, planes, ships or missiles that are designed primarily to carry nuclear weapons.
Canadians do not make a whole nuclear weapon or a whole nuclear weapons system but we do make many parts of them, mainly to sell to the United States or Britain. I have a list published in the Ploughshares Monitor in March 1990 of the companies that have made these parts since 1986. We have made parts for the following systems: the B-10 bomber, the B-52 stratofor-tress bomber, the tomahawk sea-launched cruise missile, the MX (peacekeeper) missile, the midgetman missile, the Trident submarine, the F-lll aircraft, Lynn HAS 2/3 helicopter, Nimrod MR2 aircraft, P-3 Orton aircraft, P-7A aircraft, S-3 Viking aircraft, SH-60 Seahawk helicopter and Tornado aircraft.
We make them in Waterloo, Ottawa, Rexdale, London, Kitchener, Montreal, Mississauga, Fort Erie, Haley,
Carleton Place, Scarborough, Oakville, Cambridge, Stratford, Winnipeg, Ajax and Peterborough.
The companies that made them are Fusion Penn Inc., Canadian Commercial Corporation, Garrett Canada, Litton Systems Canada, General Motors of Canada, A.T.C. Automation Tooling, Canadian Marconi Company, MIL Vickers, Vadoko International, Cercast Inc., Fleet Industries, General Electric Canada, Haley Industries Ltd., Leigh Instruments Ltd., McDonnell Douglas Canada Ltd., Magna Electronics Corporation, Vac-Aero International, Via-U-Ray Testing, Bristol Aerospace, Menesco Aerospace, West Heights Manufacturing, C.A.E. Electronics, Computing Devices, Canadair Ltd., Dowty Canada, Dowty Electronics Ltd., Unisys Canada, Spar Aerospace Ltd., Leigh Instruments and Walbar of Canada Inc.
The people who made these instruments for nuclear warfare are not bad people. They are good people who are trying to do as we all try to do, put bread on the table. These companies are engaged in legal work. Many of them are subsidized by a government program that uses $500 million per year.
The purpose of this bill is not to blame them but to declare that the people of Canada wish us now to follow a different course of action. We wish to convert war industries to peace industries so that workers like these can put bread on the table doing work that helps people live rather than work that helps people die. I ask members of this House to support this bill.
Since I will be leaving half of my time for other colleagues to give their support to this bill, I wish to close simply with a verse written 25 centuries ago by the prophet Isaiah:
The work of justice shall be peace And the effect of justice quietness and confidence forever Keep judgement and do justice For my salvation is to come and my justice be revealed.

December 11, 1992

I would like to make a few points. First of all, for the member opposite, there are no nuclear weapons in Canada. We do not have a nuclear weapons industry in Canada.
Second, Canada is committed to the peaceful use of nuclear technology.
Third, the nuclear industry is very important to Canada and nuclear technology plays a very vital role in power generation and in the medical and food industries.
I want to reiterate that Canada does not have a nuclear weapons industry. We removed all our nuclear weapons many years ago and we maintain a defensive policy today that does not include nuclear weapons. However, Canada is recognized internationally for its peacekeeping activities, for its stringent nuclear nonproliferation policy and its full-scope nuclear safeguards, for its arms control and disarmament activities and for its commitment to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. There is no nuclear weapons industry in Canada.
It is interesting to note that among the six nations of the world that have complete scientific and industrial military capability to support nuclear weapons-Canada, the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Russia and China- Canada is the only one that chooses to apply its nuclear knowledge solely for peaceful purposes, not for the production of nuclear weapons.
Canada's nuclear technology has from its very inception been under civil control. Scientists, physicists and engineers from the National Research Council established Chalk River, the birth place of Canada's nuclear technology, during the Second World War.
The Atomic Energy Control Board was established by an act of Parliament in 1946. Under civilian control AECB is responsible for ensuring that the use of nuclear technology does not pose undue risk to health, safety, security or the environment. Atomic Energy of Canada was formed as a Crown corporation in 1952 and it too is committed to the peaceful development of Canada's unique nuclear option, the Candu reactor, and to the achievement of excellence in related science and technology for the benefit not just of the present but of future Canadians.
In addition to its international obligations under the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Canada
Private Members' Business
has it own stringent nuclear non-proliferation policy and full scope safeguards.
Canada's nuclear industry contributes to quality employment for many sectors of the economy, including the mining of uranium in Saskatchewan, the production of reactor fuel in Ontario, the manufacturing of equipment, the construction and operation of electrical power plants and the production of medical equipment and radio isotopes for use in medicine, cancer treatment and food processing.
Over 30,000 people are employed directly in over 100 companies. They include scientists, engineers, miners, technicians and support staff. The industry provides over
70,000	indirect jobs as well in related supplies and services.
It is also noteworthy that many aboriginal people are employed in the mining of uranium in northern Saskatchewan. Recently, Chief Harry Cook of the La Ronge Indian Band was appointed to the Cameco board of directors.
The nuclear industry in Canada contributes over $4.5 billion to Canada's economy annually, primarily to Ontario and Quebec, but to Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and British Columbia as well. Ontario, for example, has already saved over $17 billion in foreign exchange by using uranium rather than coal for its power.
Nuclear technology is important to our exports. Prospects and orders on hand for Canadian exports of nuclear technology are considerable. They include over $1 billion of Candu technology, annual exports of $1 billion worth of uranium, heavy water supplies estimated at $.5 billion and related engineered products such as radio isotopes, cancer treatment equipment, food irradiators, training simulators and engineering services valued at $250 million.
I would like to quote Mr. David R. Anderson, the vice-president and manager of Canatom Inc., Ontario operations and chairman and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Association. On the subject of our Candu exports to Korea, he said:
For the Candu unit ordered in 1990 for the Wolsong nuclear power plant, AECL, the prime contractor to Korea Electric Power Corporation, will generate approximately 500 engineering quotation requests to be sent out from the Mississauga offices of AECL-CANDU to selected suppliers in Canadian industry for the components of the Nuclear Steam Supply System.

December 11, 1992
Private Members' Business
In addition, CANATOM Inc., acting as the architect-engineer to KEPCO through the AECL main contract, will issue from its offices in Toronto and Montreal, another 75 requisitions for purchase of equipment in Canada for the Balance of Plant, which comes under the direct control of KEPCO. Korea Heavy Industries Corporation will also place orders on Canadian suppliers.
The Wolsong 2 project will inject some $400 million into the Canadian economy, providing some 7,000 jobs over a four year period.
This is important at a time when jobs are scarce:
The breakdown is 2,000 direct and 5,000 indirect jobs. In addition, some 75 Canadian technical experts will be needed in Korea, many of whom are already living in Seoul.
Two more CANDU units for the Wolsong plant were ordered by KEPCO in September 1992. For the three units, Wolsong 2, 3 & 4, a total of 1030 orders will be placed in Canada by all parties concerned. The value to the Canadian nuclear industry is $915 million.
There are virtually no importations of nuclear equipment into Canada, however. Candu technology is developed, researched, engineered and manufactured right here in Canada. Canada has a positive balance of trade as well in two high technology sectors, aerospace and nuclear reactors, and Canada is not dependent on any country for the supply of key technologies, equipment, services or uranium supplies for its nuclear industry.
The September 1992 report in Business Magazine ranked Canada's top 100 research and development spenders. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ranked second with 1991 expenditures of $293 million, a 13.2 per cent increase over 1990.
Uranium, I would submit, is a clean source of energy. Nuclear power plants do not produce greenhouse gases. France, for example, generates 75 per cent of its electricity from nuclear reactors and has one of the lowest carbon dioxide emission levels per capita.
Canada, fortunately, is in the forefront of nuclear technology and nowhere is this more evident than in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. Nuclear medicine provides a reliable and non-intrusive way to diagnose and treat various diseases.
For example, Nordion International Inc., a Canadian company with over 500 employees and annual sales of
over $100 million, is a leading international producer, marketer and supplier of radioisotopes for nuclear medicine and research laboratories. Nordion is best known as the world's largest supplier of cobalt-60, a radioisotope used for sterilization of surgical instruments and cancer therapy.
Nordion also manufactures radiation processing equipment and supplies approximately 85 per cent of the world's requirements for molybdenum 99, moly-99, an essential radioisotope used in many medical procedures.
Theratronics International Limited is another Canadian nuclear technology company with 200 people and annual sales, mostly exports, of over $40 million. Theratronics is a pioneer in the field of radiation therapy and developed the world's first cobalt-60 cancer treatment machine in 1951. Since then the company has installed over 1,800 units in 70 countries. Over a million cancer patients a year are treated using Theratronics' products.
Canada's nuclear medicine community is highly regarded world-wide. Each year vast quantities of the world's food production are spoiled due to food borne bacteria, insect infestations and parasites. Food irradiation solves the problem.
I will not go into details, but I will say that it is because of nuclear technology that people have clean, safe food to eat.
Let me just summarize very briefly. Canada does not have a nuclear weapons industry. Canada has maintained the steadfast commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear technology and the Canadian nuclear industry is making a remarkable contribution to Canada's economy in terms of quality employment, significant export performance, providing a clean, efficient reliable source of energy, providing for our energy security and the development of human, intellectual and natural resources.

December 11, 1992

If the hon. member was looking at that poor, forlorn new chairman of Ontario Hydro, appointed by the Ontario NDP government, he is receiving only $425,000 a year, I understand, and I do not know how the poor fellow is going to exist on that.
I think the NDP government in Ontario would be better off putting some money into road maintenance budgets to make the highways safe for people in this country so we would have some safety on the roads.
First, all Canadian governments since that of Lester Pearson in the 1960s have been in support of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Regardless of political party, all governments have agreed on this point and have actually sought ways to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This is one of the fundamental values that Canadian governments and indeed the Canadian public have in common.
Second, in looking at the bill of the hon. member for Trinity-Spadina, one reads that Canada should convert to civilian uses technologies and skills that are used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
Under Canada's policy of non-proliferation, Canada does not export uranium to the United States because that country has a nuclear weapons program. Canada does not have a nuclear weapons program and we have never had one. However, we sell steel to the United States. We sell plastics to the United States and several other non-nuclear materials to the United States and these materials could be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons with no relationship whatsoever to the actual terminology of nuclear.
Is the NDP in sponsoring this bill today asking us to sever all trade with the United States in all materials that are used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons? Is it asking us not to send steel to the United States? Is it asking us not to sell our plastic products to the United States, or a host of other products we sell to them that may be used in the actual product that is produced in the nuclear weapons industry? They are certainly using it in the manufacture of cars, for example, the steel industry.
As a supporter of the non-proliferation treaty, Canada supports the right of developing countries to develop nuclear technology for peaceful means only. Many poorer countries are interested in nuclear energy because huge amounts of energy can be supplied. You cannot improve the way of life of people unless they
Private Members' Business
have an energy source to modernize their production in their every day life, even the decencies of electric lights and fridges for the saving of food.
Canadian policy is that Canada will not give nuclear technology to a country unless that country agrees to International safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is interesting to note that the Candu reactor is the most useless of reactors for those countries wanting to use the uranium in missile warheads. Heavy water is used as a coolant in the Candu reactor. This means that it uses natural uranium. As such, there is no need for a reprocessing facility in the Candu reactor system. The proportion of fissionable uranium, U-235, that is produced from the Candu is only 0.7 per cent.
If a country wanted to acquire a nuclear energy facility with the underlying intention of obtaining weapons-grade uranium for warheads, it would need a reprocessing facility to make this kind of uranium.
As indicated, the Candu is useless in this regard as it does not come equipped with a reprocessing facility and that is one of the safeguards of the Canadian Candu reactor. Canada is a major supporter of the non-proliferation treaty and has been since day one as one of the founders of it.
Of all the countries in the world, Canada is the leader in the promoting of the non-proliferation treaty dealing with nuclear weapons. There are only six that independently have the nuclear technology to develop nuclear weapons programs. These are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, the Peoples' Republic of China and Canada.
Other countries suspected of having nuclear weapons got the technology from other sources and did not develop it domestically.
Of the six countries I listed that have innovative nuclear technology, Canada is the only one with the capability to develop nuclear weapons but did not do so. We have never done so. This certainly says something about the kind of people Canadians are.
From the days of Lester B. Pearson it has been a policy of Canada not to develop an independent nuclear weapons system. Every government to date has stuck with that.

December 11, 1992
Private Members' Business
Canada has a nuclear program dedicated to peaceful purposes only. It has developed the Candu nuclear power reactor, a wide variety of medical and industrial radiochemical products, and a uranium industry that is the largest exporter in the world.
I just wish we could see the day when the critics of Canada's peaceful nuclear industry would begin to realize and talk about the tremendous strides that have been made in medicine in the nuclear field. Chalk River is a perfect example of what has been done in the field of medicine.
To ensure that these industries are not jeopardized by links to nuclear weapons, great care has been taken to develop international agreements with our trading partners. The important segments of Canada's nuclear non-proliferation policy are the bilateral agreements signed with all trading partners and the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, which I have mentioned.
That is administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency. We have about 20 people working at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.
From the very beginning of international trade in nuclear products and technologies, Canada has required assurances from trading partners that Canadian-supplied items would not be used in any nuclear weapons programs. This policy has been strengthened, starting in 1974, requiring all trading partners to make the following basic commitments in bilateral nuclear co-operation agreements:
Canadian-supplied items will not be associated with nuclear explosive devices.
A provision for fall-back safeguards must be made if the International Atomic Energy Agency is unable to continue with its inspections and safeguard functions.
No transfer of Canadian-supplied items can be made without prior consent by Canada. They cannot be transferred from one country to another without Canadian consent. It is part of the agreement.
Enrichment of Canadian-supplied uranium beyond 20 per cent is prohibited; and adequate physical protection will be applied to ensure compliance with the previous conditions.
I see you are giving me the high sign, Mr. Speaker. I just want to say that Canada has been one of the leaders
in the nuclear industry for peaceful purposes. Yes, we have a lot of expertise and good technology in this field, but it should be supported by the public at large for the good work that it has done in medicine and in biology and many other fields.
It is a great science. I do not know why we are debating this bill today because it really does not apply to Canada.

I know that he is a very avuncular fellow. I do appreciate your recognizing me and the opportunity to participate in this debate.
I am sure that the thousands, if not millions, of people across this country who believe very strongly, now that the cold war is over, in a peace dividend will be very disappointed that the speaker for the Liberal Party when speaking on this bill not only completely misconceived it but essentially spoke against it.
It is very revealing that the only person the Liberal Party puts up is someone who would go on about the Candu reactor which has absolutely nothing to do with the resolution before this House.
This resolution calls for conversion from a nuclear military weapons industry, not civilian industry, but nuclear military industry. It is a very critical and important issue to millions of people across this country.
We are not surprised that the member for Winnipeg South would oppose this resolution, although she too also misconceived the point of the resolution.
I want to congratulate the member for Trinity-Spadi-na who has pursued this issue diligently for many years and has finally seen this bill come before the House. It is a great tribute to him.
He has served this House very well. He has indicated he will not be running in the next election and this House will miss him. He has been a conscience of the House on this and many other issues. I want to assure him that if I and others are back, we will carry on the fight for the important concept he has embodied in this resolution.
Under the rules of the House, if we cannot get agreement and the matter dies on the Order Paper, I would ask all members to agree that this be referred to the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs for consideration.

This bill calls for conversion of the nuclear weapons industry in Canada. It should not be misunderstood. This country is completely committed to the manufacture of components of nuclear weapons systems and the export of those components particularly to the United States of America. This bill by establishing the national policy of conversion is a very important bill for our country to accept.
I want to use the few minutes I have to draw the attention of House and of the country to an important companion study done by the Standing Committee on External Affairs and International Trade.
Last year and leading into early this year, a sub-committee on arms exports undertook a very comprehensive study of the future of Canadian military goods production and export. In the course of that study, it made a series of important recommendations, two of which bear directly on this resolution.
The first is recommendation 12. It recommends that an export control list be established which would include the components of nuclear weapons. This recommendation was unanimously accepted by the committee and recommended to this House by the members, including representatives from the government side and from the Liberal side. Where are they today? Why are they not standing up in support of this bill which would embody at least in part that unanimous recommendation?
The committee also recommended a number of other steps which would be in the spirit of this bill. It recommended that the government act upon the 1982 request of the United Nations General Assembly to prepare a national assessment of the relationship between disarmament and development in Canada.
The committee recommended that the Canadian defence procurement policy be changed to foster a leading edge in innovative industrial capability in civilian as well as military high technology products in areas of surveillance and monitoring, verification, sovereignty protection and peacekeeping.
The committee also recommended that the mandate of the Defence Industry Production Program be changed to encourage conversion and diversification and that it
Private Members' Business
primarily focus on technologies with significant civilian spin-off potential.
It also called on DIPP funds to be available to assist when a defence industry had been closed. I want to conclude with drawing the attention of the House to this most important recommendation which is at the heart of this important bill brought before the House by the member for Trinity-Spadina.
I will read recommendation 20 it in its entirety.
The Committee recommends that the government support the establishment of a Canadian Diversification and Conversion Resource Centre. The Centre should gather and disseminate data on diversification and conversion efforts in Canada and overseas, on federal, provincial and municipal programs which might assist diversification and conversion efforts, and on new products and markets. The Centre should also monitor Canadian and international defence production, defence industry support and military goods export control policies, and encourage the establishment of conversion committees.
This bill calls upon the nuclear weapons industry to establish conversion committees and the recommendation would broaden that to cover all military production in this country.
I commend this bill to the House and urge all members to support it.

The bill is to provide for the conversion to civilian uses of technologies and skills used in the nuclear weapons industry. In prefacing my remarks, I should point out that my own constituency, particularly the community of Trail, produced the heavy water for the Manhattan project. The Cominco Special Metals and Electronics Division produced a lot of the sophisticated technology used in President Reagan's ill-fated Star Wars program.
Therefore, to say that we have never had an industry in Canada that has contributed to the nuclear weapons industry and delivery system is quite wrong.
The main purpose of my remarks is to point out, in supporting the principle of this bill, that there are opportunities that I and many others feel are being missed for Canada to get aboard, gear up for and contribute in a major way to what should be and will be a major nuclear clean-up industry on a world-wide scale.

Private Members' Business
The delegation of my colleagues and I, headed by my friend, the member for Okanagan-Shuswap and three other New Democratic members were the first Canadian parliamentary delegation to visit the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State at Richland, Washington last March to investigate what is going on at that facility. It is a major clean-up.
I will read very briefly what they are doing to clean up the mess left over from the Manhattan project, the number of plutonium development facilities and about nine reactors that used to exist on that site. It is setting the pace and is a laboratory for the world in terms of the nuclear clean-up industry. I just want to point out what is happening in the local area. I will quote from The Economist of August 15, 1992:
Doing something about this problem is revitalising the local economy. More than 16,000 technicians, engineers and scientists are now beavering away on the site. During the past year the population of Richland grew by 10%. Home prices have risen 30% in three years-unusual in an environmental disaster-area. As Ralph DeSibio of Westinghouse Hanford, an erstwhile plutonium producer and now the prime contractor for the clean-up, puts it, ""We're sitting on a waste mine.""
It may be a waste mine but it is a gold mine for many of the people there. It can be a major contributor to more and sophisticated jobs in Canada, if we accept our responsibilities to help lead the way.
The federal government should be co-ordinating and communicating with American Westinghouse officials and attempting to get a piece of the action or at least be in an observer capacity at that site in Washington. In that way, we would be in a better position to clean up our own matters, whether they stem from military nuclear hardware or the clean-up of civilian nuclear problems. That is another major problem that we have not dealt with either. It would also allow us to contribute, in a more meaningful way, and we should be beginning to do that as well, in the major problems in the nuclear industry in what used to be the Soviet Union.
For a number of reasons, including demand reasons and the state of public opinion, the nuclear industry in Canada, and I am mainly talking about the peaceful nuclear industry, is gearing down in many ways. We can create employment, create technology, be on the leading edge in the so-called global marketplace that the government likes to talk to us about, if we are in a position to understand the clean-up technologies that are taking place. We could lend a helping hand to what otherwise
will be a major disaster for the whole world and help to clean up some of the problems left over by the change of regimes and the inappropriate and old fashioned nuclear technology that existed in the Soviet Union.
That is a disaster waiting to happen. We have potential disasters from the peacetime nuclear industry in Canada unless we are in a position to get on board and help to clean up this major waste disposal problem on a worldwide basis. There are opportunities there, let us grab them.
The intent of the bill before us is to begin to move us in that direction and I hope the government does.

Canadians can be proud of their country's record on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. Traditionally, these issues have been among the priorities of Canadian foreign policy since the Second World War.
In the late 1940s Canada rejected the development of nuclear weapons. Instead, Canadian efforts in this area have targeted the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Electrical power generation, medical applications of radioisotopes, are among the contributions that Canadian nuclear science has made to human betterment. A corollary of this policy of focusing on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was the decision to pursue in a consequent and unremitting manner initiatives towards nuclear arms control and non-proliferation. Canada has always stood on the side of peace and opposed war.
Canada was among the first nations to ratify the non-proliferation treaty in 1969. The treaty continues as the essential cornerstone of the global non-proliferation system. Canada's unwavering support for the NPT rests on its indispensable character in stemming the spread of nuclear weapons. At the same time, the NPT also permits the dissemination of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Canada, through the International Atomic Energy Agency and other channels, has played a strong role in this area.

The essential character of the NPT has prompted Canada to promote actively universal adoption of the treaty. Such a stance supports Canada's ultimate objective: the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
Canada has always been in the forefront of multilateral efforts to reduce conventional weapons, stem nuclear proliferation, and otherwise work for peace. The end of the cold war greatly reduced the threat of nuclear war, but this most welcome development also brought to the fore new and pressing challenges.
For that reason, the Prime Minister, in a seminal speech last year at Johns Hopkins University, set out an agenda for action on non-proliferation.
First, the NPT must be strengthened by its indefinite extension and by universal accession to it. These objectives were reflected in the political declaration issued by summit leaders meeting in Munich last year. Since then, Canada has participated in multilateral and bilateral initiatives to urge acceptance of the NPT. These efforts have met with considerable success and, to date, 155 countries have acceded to the NPT.
Nonetheless, a number of key countries remain outside the treaty. Further efforts are needed to persuade states like India, Pakistan, Algeria, Israel, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. This is particularly important as we move to prepare for the NPT Extension Conference in 1995.
Second, nuclear cheating must be stopped by strengthening the mandate of the International Atomic Energy Agency and increasing its resources. Canada will support giving the IAEA the teeth-the authority and the resources-to inspect any time anywhere. To this end, a Canadian expert is participating in a high-level group to develop strengthened and streamlined safeguards.
Third, controls on the export of nuclear technologies, materials and equipment must be tightened. With strong pressure from Canada and others the Nuclear Suppliers Group has agreed to require the acceptance of full-scope safeguards by recipient countries as a condition of supply.
Private Members' Business
Fourth, the migration of nuclear brainpower must be stopped. To that end, Canada has contributed generously to the establishment of International Science and Technology Centres in Kiev and Moscow so that scientists of Russia and Ukraine apply their knowledge and expertise to peaceful endeavours and not add to the world's stock of nuclear weapons and delivery systems.
Fifth, security co-operation must be strengthened regionally to reduce underlying causes of tensions, particularly in such chronic hot spots as the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East and the sub-continent. Canada is bringing its experience and expertise in verification to the arms control working group of the Middle East peace talks and we have been instrumental in encouraging the countries of the north Pacific to consider ways to enhance their security through cooperation and dialogue.

According to our Standing Orders, on a Friday there is an automatic deferral of the vote. We had sought, since the intent of the House was clear, unanimous consent to have the vote now to allow those who want to vote against it to do so and allow those who want to vote for it to do so. That was denied.
We had looked at the possibility under the Standing Orders. The means exist for those who would deny this coming to a vote to do so and they did so. Certainly the position of the government remains the same. We are ready to vote. It is one of those factors in our Standing Orders for our own protection.

Albeit a special section that applies to one province, this is the Parliament of Canada. There is very real concern on any matter affecting the amendment of the Constitution of Canada, be it Bill 101 in Quebec, be it founding races, be it the fact that we are replaying the Constitution.

I appreciate the fact that the hon. member from Sorel supported the request for unanimous consent, as did hon. members sitting as Independents and our Liberal and NDP colleagues.
I am pleased to say that the bill before the House today, now at third reading, has met with a very broad consensus. The bill itself and the proposed amendments were given thorough consideration by a legislative committee. There was also a detailed study by various environmental groups. This legislation is the culmination of many years' work, as a result of which we were able to table this bill in the House.

Government Orders

An act respecting the protection of certain species of animals and plants was presented for second reading on March 17 and reported back by the legislative committee on June 18.
There are some changes proposed to the bill and I am happy to report that the changes, as far as I know, are the object of a wide consensus on behalf of all members of this House. There has been a very inclusive process of study of this bill in the legislative committee.
May I also add that the parliamentary secretary for the Department of the Environment, the member for Brandon-Souris, played a key role, as he did on other pieces of legislation, in facilitating the work before the legislative committee on this matter. I thank him today on the record, given the fact that as usual he will have done most of the work in the parliamentary process in advancing this bill.
This bill is about the important stress that is now on the world's wildlife populations. We know there is considerable stress on our ecosystems, on the species themselves, and within the species in certain cases. In the case of Canada this is especially significant given the richness of our geography and the fact that we have very key species that are threatened and measures are required to protect them.
The act is new federal legislation. It will protect wild animals and plants by regulating international and interprovincial trade in them and their parts and products.
There are three objectives: first, to help protect wild animal and plant species in foreign countries from poaching and smuggling; second, to protect Canada's wild animal and plant species from illegal trade; and, third, to protect Canada's ecosystems from the introduction of designated harmful species or so-called biological pollutants. It will replace the 1941 Game Export Act and regulations first made in 1975 under the Export and Import Permits Act through which the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species is implemented in Canada, otherwise known as CITES.
As mentioned a few seconds ago, this piece of legislation has gone under some very thorough and very extensive debate within committee itself and some
amendments address the concerns that were expressed in the committee.
For example, this new act will allow Canada to support the efforts of other countries to conserve and protect species, especially endangered ones. It will also prohibit wild animals and plants from being brought into Canada if they have been obtained or otherwise dealt with in violation of foreign conservation laws.
There is a very legitimate trade in certain species or threatened wild animals or plants going on now. That being the case, I should point out that this bill is something that will not impede that trade but will rather create a context in which it can happen with the safeguards we are all seeking.

I do not want to go into details because we have agreed and it is already late; this is the last day of the session. I could talk about this bill at length, but I do not intend to do so. I know that my colleague and friend, the member for Davenport, also wants to give us his comments and I will be very pleased to hear them. My friend and colleague, the member for Skeena, also wants to add some comments and I will be very happy to hear them too. I just want to tell members one thing in closing: the bill will help Canada meet its obligations under the biodiversity convention which the Prime Minister ratified recently.
Two conventions which bind Canada internationally came out of the conference called the earth summit held in Rio de Janeiro, as you will recall. One is a convention on climate change and the other is on biodiversity or, if you prefer, the preservation of biological diversity. Canada is the first industrialized country in the world to sign and ratify both conventions. We did so with the unanimous support of the provinces and territories and I must tell you that we are very proud of it. Today's bill will help us meet this commitment.
So, without further ado, knowing that it is already late and recognizing that the ultimate goal is to pass this bill, I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your patience and take the opportunity, since this may be the last time that I speak to you, to wish you and all those who work in this House, and especially those who contribute to its work, wonderful holidays. Mr. Speaker, I also hope that you will be able to enjoy this ecosystem which-

We welcome on our side of the House the return of this bill roughly 13 months after it was introduced the first time.
We think that this legislation is long overdue. We want to report that a considerable amount of work was done in committee with a very strong and vigorous input on the part of the member for Skeena, who I am sure is very anxious to speak in a few moments on the strength of the bill, both in terms of international and interprovincial trade of endangered species.
In essence, the purpose of the bill is to protect certain species of animals and plants when it comes to international and interprovincial trade. The prohibition, and this is important for the Canadian travelling public, is to the effect that a person should not import into Canada any animals or plants in contravention of any law of any foreign state, meaning any law that is endorsed and subscribed to in connection with foreign trade by nations which adhere to the convention on international trade in endangered species.
This bill brings Canada in line with other international accords such as the convention on biodiversity and especially with the convention on international trade in endangered species.
It intends to protect biological diversity globally. It intends to band illegal trade of endangered species, fauna and flora.
Last year a convention on international trade in endangered species was strengthened and a list of protected species was extended to include over 1,000 species.
These international actions are no reason for complacency. The House may have heard about research reports that through poaching, the African rhino is on the verge of extinction in southern Africa. The African elephant is still in a precarious state because of the slaughter for the purpose of providing tusks and profit making.
A report issued only this week by the United Nations Environment Program warns that between 100 and 300 species a day, flora and fauna combined, become extinct through habitat destruction, especially through the destruction of tropical rainforests, coral reefs, wetlands and other biologically diverse and rich ecosystems.
Therefore, extinction is not someone else's problem. In the remote areas in Canada, for instance, there are at least 25 endangered species.
My next point is that while we support the passage of this bill because it is important, we would like it to go further. We would like to have fines increased to ensure that they are in line with other international penalties for illegal trade, and possibly the member for Skeena will address this subject more effectively based on his wide-ranging experience.
The fines as far as we are concerned could be brought to $100,000 for individuals and it would not be too little. The fines and criminal charges must be strict enough to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for smugglers.
Aside from the offences, this bill is about international trade, and yet we need parallel legislation which takes an ecosystem management and conservation approach to the protection of species. That is what some of us have proposed by way of private members' bills, including a private members' bill by the member for Davenport, Bill C-209, which I would like to bring to the attention of the minister in the House. I am sure that he already knows about it. This bill intends to provide protection for Canada's own biological diversity. It is intended to identify, protect, if you like rehabilitate, flora and fauna threatened or endangered by human activities in our nation.
Finally, once this bill is given third reading, we on this side of the House urge the government to move swiftly with its promulgation and to make good on the government's commitment contained in the green plan to increase public awareness through environmental education, environmental communications, the schools, through all means that are available. We will build on the urgent need to strengthen wildlife protection for the enrichment and enjoyment of present and, first and foremost because of the pressures to which the minister himself alluded earlier, for future generations.
December 11, 1992

We are glad to give support to this bill and to take this opportunity to urge the minister to also take an initiative for the protection of Canada's own biological diversity. I know that it is close to his heart and that he will move swiftly with the determination which characterizes him, for which he is well known, to fill this gap for which this measure is badly needed.

",,,Hon.   Chas. L. Caccia@Davenport,
3928768,ca.proc.d.1992-12-11.7.3.1.17,1992-12-11,a23123f4-9e40-4b5a-8a6d-1cf81a56c4a8,ca.m.9679,Mr. Jim Fulton (Skeena):,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,WILD ANIMAL AND PLANT PROTECTION ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-42, and that good will actually got it to the point of being able to pass today. I was worried earlier today as I sat and the hours went by that perhaps those which we are here speaking on behalf of, which are the wild plants and animals of this planet, might not have any voices speaking on their behalf as this year rings its way out.
This has been a profound act of political will. It is a kind of consultation that I do not think very many pieces of legislation have ever been through. A national-interprovincial-territorial consultation process began in 1982. The legislation itself actually started to formulate back in
1987.	It has been a very long and tedious process to get it to where it is today.
Frankly, it is now a pretty good piece of legislation and the minister should be complimented for having ridden herd as he has and provided the necessary political will to actually get it to the floor of the House. I know, with the legislative agenda that there has been in the last little while, getting a piece of legislation about wild plants and animals to the floor of this Chamber with all of the other competing interests has not been an easy task.
I also think that the minister and those on the government side listened at least with due diligence to the concerns raised from this side about the issues of fines. They were substantially altered. They are considerable. It is in that area to which I direct my remarks for a moment, because I think there is a responsibility not so much now of the Minister of the Environment but of his colleagues in the field of justice and in law enforcement to make sure that law enforcement personnel generally in this country are aware of what this bill is all about.
As my friend from Davenport pointed out, this is more about plants and animal species that are being trafficked internationally and in some cases interprovincially than it is to protect the biological nature of this country. We do not have a lot of endangered species, in fact we have
Government Orders
very few that are listed under CITES. We have 195 endangered species at the moment that are listed by COSEWIC, Canada's committee in this field on endangered plants and animals. There is a great deal of work to be done in that area.
On the education of the enforcement personnel, the minister is committed to $12.3 million under the green plan-I spoke to him earlier today. I am quite confident that the funds are there and are going to be delivered- and for the 29 new person years. I know that excellent public servants such as Mr. McLean in the minister's department will be eagerly anticipating learning later today that the 29 person years will in fact still be delivered by the Minister of the Environment, perhaps over the next five years instead of over the next six, to get it jump-started and going.
So there is that one big job on educating enforcers of the law.
The other much bigger one is to educate the bench. In my own experience, it follows the issue of the exportation of things like bear gall bladders and paws and various ""exotic parts"" of Canadian wildlife internationally-
Regrettably when offenders are finally caught, charged, and brought before the courts such as some of my own constituents, the sentences are inappropriate. One fellow in particular was before the courts after having been convicted more than 100 times already and came back before the bench and was not given what I consider to be an appropriate sentence.
I am hoping that all members of this House will take some interest in this issue, in particular the Minister of Justice, and those who have some direct access to educational materials for the bench. Make sure that the judges and the courts in this country understand the seriousness with which this bill was taken by the members who worked on it.
The fines are not inconsiderable. They go up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for corporations that are involved. There are extensive periods of incarceration, and it is certainly something that I as a member of this House, and I know the Minister of the Environment is hoping that these kinds of sentences will be handed down.

December 11, 1992
Government Orders
I know that when a corporate entity appears before a court in any area of this country with an orchid in hand and the lawyer gets up and extols the virtue of the corporation and the client and says: ""Oh, my Lord, you are not possibly going to put my client away for six months or a year and fine him or her $300,000 over this one measley orchid?"" I hope the bench will come to understand that this legislation, at least in the foreseeable future is going to become more, not less, important.
According to Edward Wilson, the global authority at the moment on the loss of biodiversity, we are losing at least 10 entire species an hour on this planet. It is mind boggling. That is an entire species of parrots, entire species of orchids, entire species of other forms of plants and animals. In Somalia there is not one elephant left. At the turn of the century we were losing maybe a specie a month but the time clock is accelerating so fast that legislation like this has become mandatory.
Even though the fines and degree of incarceration were not brought to the levels that I think were necessary, meaning there is a possibility of Canada continuing to be a conduit for smuggling, and a conduit for poaching, I would hope through stringent and rigid enforcement, there would be zero tolerance for the smuggling of endangered plants and animals at the border.
I do not care what excuses some people have when they have a little snake hidden inside their cowboy boots, that they are taking and saying they did not know it was worth $100,000. I just do not buy it any more.
The amount of money being made, as we heard from witnesses in terms of the traffic in endangered plants and animals is comparable to the drug trade. We are talking hundreds of millions being exchanged for things like bear gall bladders for people who think it is some kind of erotic medicine. It is a very serious state of affairs and I am pleased this bill is being passed.
I know I told the minister and my friend from Davenport I was not going to talk very long, but I can get wound up into these things quite quickly.
We want to pass this, Madam Speaker, and I do have a few other things I need to say.
The minister pointed out the bill does three things. Canadians should not be fooled by the brand name. It is called the Wild Plant and Animal Protection Act. It does not protect those endangered species and biosystems inside Canada. This brings us into compliance with CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. There is about 50,000 species now listed in the appendices of CITES. Most of them are plants like orchids but there are many mammals listed in it and Canada's own COSEWIC listings should be included.
It does protect some of Canada's wild plant and animal species from illegal trade. It protects some Canadian ecosystems from the introduction of designated harmful species and it helps to protect wild animal and plant species in foreign countries from poaching and smuggling. The initiatives of the legislation are good.
As I said earlier, the kind of consultations the Minister of the Environment conducted are first class where there are consultations with the provinces and the territories and we get them all on board.
Now the job is getting the enforcers on board, the 29 professionals who can identify the particular endangered species that are often smuggled in, particularly at our airports but also at our ports and in vehicles coming into Canada. It is a big, big job and the public needs to be educated about the severity of it.
I do hope the minister will soon take the next step. That is to move on the kind of endangered species legislation there is at least in the United States. I would not take it as a specific model, but clearly there needs to be a legislative move in this country to protect endangered spaces and endangered species. I know the minister is committed to doing that.
I will end by saying it is a bill that Canadians should not be tricked by. It does not do a whole lot for plants and animals inside Canada, but it is a very useful weapon in the arsenal of dealing with international crime, even those international petty criminals who think that just smuggling a few orchids is not that bad. There is big money in it and has to be stopped.

I am pleased this is the last debate to take place before Christmas because it is a bill well worthy of singing a few tunes to. I congratulate the Minister of the Environment for getting it through.
