The commission's report agrees with Kitty and with the views of many of us who followed the horrific details of Kitty's ordeal.
After suffering a violent sexual attack, Kitty was subjected to a further assault by an insensitive and callous justice system. The victim was again victimized. She was forced to serve the needs of a criminal justice system. The system did not provide for her needs.
1 want to commend Kitty for her courage and determination, for not allowing the justice system to go unchallenged and for exposing the flaws and deficiencies within the justice system to the scrutiny of all Canadians.
The justice system failed Kitty. I urge the government to act immediately to make the changes necessary to ensure victims of crimes are not victimized again by the very system which is supposed to help and serve them.
Happy birthday, Kitty. Thank you for what you have done on behalf of all victims of crime in this country.

However, the request from the province of New Brunswick to entrench these principles within the Canadian Constitution specifically for that province is both a timely and symbolic measure.

In February of this year William Henry Williams was sentenced to six years in prison for incest. Last month his sentence was reduced to four years. Now, after only nine months in prison, he is eligible for parole and his daughter Sandra is afraid.
For 13 years this man molested his daughter, sometimes raping her twice a day. A few years in jail is far too lenient for a man who inflicted such a lifetime of suffering on an innocent daughter.
What measures will the minister take to ensure that people convicted of committing these horrifying crimes remain in jail for at least as long as the abuse took place, and that they serve their entire sentences?

As well, and I appreciate that this is a new area of the law, we have made allowance in the law for victim impact statements to be given to the parole boards and also any victim will be given all of the details of the parole.
This has been in effect for a month now and we are monitoring the parole board hearings where victims have been in attendance. As far as we can determine, it is working well and we will continue to monitor the system.

Does the Solicitor General know that the band leadership of Kanesatake is very concerned about the security of its community and it asks the federal government for help with respect to policing.
In fact, the Mohawk have asked the government for assistance in training the community watch force. They want a liaison arrangement with the RCMP so that this force can be trained properly and they will have a competent force composed of both native and non-native people.
When is the Solicitor General going to meet with Grand Chief Peltier to enter into a plan to implement this request?

We are approaching the third anniversary of the incarceration of David Spencer and Christine Lamont. Canadians across the country and right here on Parliament Hill are maintaining a vigil on their behalf.
We have learned of Christine's illness. Hopefully it is a minor illness, but it could be life threatening. The prison conditions are dangerous and unacceptable.
On humanitarian grounds alone, will the Prime Minister honour his commitment to Premier McKenna and ask for their expulsion?

In point of fact, the concept of expulsion which I raised with the President of Brazil and have subsequently written about to the new President of Brazil has been bandied about in a manner that is quite unfair to the families involved.
There seems to be the view that all one has to do is go and ask for the expulsion of a criminal, or an accused person or a convicted person in that country and the President will oblige.

Routine Proceedings
It is important that members of the House understand this is not the case. Both the President and the Minister of Justice have advised that this is not the case. It is a most exceptional procedure and one that is used with the greatest of reluctance.
Also, my hon. friend refers to Christine's illness. The illness reported was swollen ankles. The doctor from the Consulate General in Sao Paulo attended upon her in the prison and is apparently assured that everything is okay.
The Secretary of State for External Affairs has been employing every effort and I have been in personal touch with the new President of Brazil on the question of the appeal.
We have been informed that the attorneys for the parties apparently neglected to include a document which brought about a revision in the procedure itself irrespective of the appropriate efforts of the attorneys for the Government of Canada.
We would like to see the treaty concluded between Brazil and Canada as quickly as possible so that the two Canadians can then come to Canada, pursuant to the provisions of this treaty, and be dealt with in Canada under Canadian law. This would be, in our judgment anyway, much more humane and much more reasonable. We could deal with it much more expeditiously.
I will take just a second of the House's time to explain to my hon. friend that we are in close and ongoing contact with both families. We are deeply concerned about this matter. We are employing every effort on behalf of both individuals.
There are some 550 Canadians held in prisons around the world for various offences, in much the same way as Canadian penitentiaries house nationals from other countries today.
We are trying to operate within the law and to cause that law to be expedited in the interests of these two Canadians.
I want to give my friend and the House the assurance that we are employing every effort on behalf of Christine Lamont and David Spencer because we believe they are worthy of our attention and concern. We are giving this matter every effort that we possibly can.

With respect to the issue of expulsion, the chief legal adviser to the Secretary of State for External Affairs has said to the justice committee: ""The Brazilian Minister of Justice also said to us that he would be prepared to facilitate an expulsion if that were to come forward at the state-to-state level"".
In view of the Prime Minister's undertaking and his personal interest in this case, will the Prime Minister now make the request at the state-to-state level for expulsion which, according to the legal adviser to the Secretary of State for External Affairs, would be responded to positively?

House Leader,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,PATENT ACT,ALLOCATION OF TIME TO CONSIDER REPORT AND THIRD READING STAGES OF BILLC-91,"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask you to refuse to accept this motion of time allocation on debate on Bill C-91 at report and third reading to a further two sitting days. In some ways this is a rather unusual point of order.
I am not so much asking you to interpret whether the Standing Orders of the House are being properly applied so much as whether the Standing Orders applied in this instance are consistent with the over-all responsibility of the House to make decisions in a parliamentary democratic fashion.
I am seeking to make only one point; that the motion to curtail debate on Bill C-91 at this time and in this way goes against what you once called ""fair play and common sense"" and that it is offensive to ""the sense of what is appropriate under certain circumstances and which is acceptable to reasonable people"".
Those were your words, by the way, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to begin this short point of order by submitting that as Speaker you have a special responsibility to address this issue. Mr. Speaker, you have both the authority and the responsibility to prohibit a motion of time allocation if, in your judgment, it is being used abusively.
There have been several occasions in parliamentary history when a Speaker has been called upon to intervene in this way. I would like to refer to two cases. One is the intervention of closure by Speaker Brand in the 1880s and the other your ruling, Mr. Speaker, of April 14, 1987.
I know I do a disservice to the history of Parliament by trying to distil Speaker Brand's famous closure ruling into a few sentences, but the history is clear. Parnell in the parliamentary Irish caucus abused the rules and obstructed the will of the majority. The democratic nature of the House was threatened by that abuse. The public wanted this abuse to end, and the Speaker intervened. He was acting in the interests of both the institution and the democracy that it served.
Over a century later, the Speaker of this House was asked to intervene to prevent what was perceived as an abuse of the rules when this caucus used dilatory tactics to prevent a time allocation motion from being moved to end debate on Bill C-22, a drug patent act.
I was House leader of the New Democratic Party caucus, the current government House leader was the then minister responsible for Bill C-22, the chair is still occupied by the same Speaker, and the bill before the House at that time and today are very similar. These parallels lend a parenthetic irony but nothing more to this point of order.
With the players all here in the House, it is not necessary to relate the history of your April 14, 1987 ruling. I would like to cite parts of it as I find, Mr. Speaker, you make my argument most compelling. You said:
It is essential to our democratic system that controversial issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics should be permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public support for their point of view.
Sooner or later every issue must be decided and the decision will be taken by a majority. Rules of procedure protect both the minority and the majority. They are designed to allow the full expression of views on both sides of an issue. They provide the opposition with a means to delay a decision. They also provide the majority with a means of limiting debate in order to arrive at a decision. This is the kind of balance essential to the procedure of a democratic assembly. Our rules were certainly never designed to permit the total frustration of one side or another, the total stagnation of debate or the total paralysis of the system.
When negotiations fail there comes a time when the Chair is obliged to consider what are its own responsibilities. One of the functions of the Speaker is to ensure that the House is able to transact its business. This does not mean that the Chair plays any part in assisting the government in the management of its business agenda.
There comes a time when the Chair has to face its responsibilities. When circumstances change and the rules of procedure provide no solution the Chair must fall back on its discretion in the interests of the House and all its members. This may require the Chair to modify or vary an earlier decision.
Notice of time allocation motions after only a few hours of debate at any stage of a bill can be an abuse.
December 9, 1992

Both time allocation motions and dilatory motions are open to abuse. When such tactics are entered upon by either government or opposition the delicate balance of democratic parliamentary government can be easily upset. The maintenance of that balance is a fundamental responsibility of the Speaker.
The question is: What is time allocation and closure and what are the checks on its abuse? In your consideration, Mr. Speaker, I ask you to reflect upon the nature of our time allocation and closure motions and the manner in which the Standing Orders governing them were adopted.
Closure and time allocation are two separate concepts. While both restrain debate, the first is a motion to curtail it, and the second is a motion to structure it. In current Canadian practice that distinction is somewhat blurred, but in Britain the distinction continued and there are safeguards against abuse in both circumstances.
In the use of closure, a minimum number of members must support the closure motion. The Speaker has a power, which is often exercised, to refuse to accept a motion of closure if in his or her view it is premature. In the use of time allocation, of guillotine motions, there are different safeguards in Britain.
As was formerly the case here, a debate is required before a time allocation motion is adopted. One safeguard against abuse then is public debate. This serves not only to permit an explanation of the need to use the measure, but is an added incentive for negotiation to be used instead of unilateral government action.
Another safeguard is the practice of allocating a minimum amount of time to be given to consideration of each section of a bill. That way it does not occur in Britain, as it could today on Bill C-91, that a bill is passed without certain clauses or amendments being explained or rebutted at all. Under our rules we have no such safeguards. The motion for time allocation is not debatable and it not amendable.
Mr. Speaker, you once told us that division bells are no substitute for debate. By accepting a time allocation motion which cannot possibly provide for debate on all components of a bill, no matter what the collective efforts on both sides of the House are, we will arrive at a situation in which votes have become a substitute for debate.
Government Orders
I would argue that if division bells are no substitute for debate then it is also true that divisions are no substitute for debate. You may hear it argued that since the House adopted the time allocation mechanism, this mechanism has the support of the House. Since the House passed the motion, the House supports it. I ask the Chair to consider the questionable nature of this argument in the context of Parliament's best traditions of implementing change as consensually as possible.
The changes the House adopted to its Standing Orders in 1991 were not consensual. They were supported not by the House but by one side of the House only.
Is time allocation warranted at this point? The evidence is to the contrary. Considerable time was spent in committee discussing the timetabling of the bill but if this was intended as filibuster, it did not work. The opposition parties not only agreed to but volunteered a proposal which ended the roadblock in committee and ensured that witnesses were heard on this important bill.
I believe the record shows that there have been no dilatory tactics to prevent consideration of Bill C-91.
I do not want to misrepresent the case. If we could have successfully defeated this bill through a sustained filibuster or dilatory tactics we would have. That is what we attempted to do back in 1987.
Perhaps the discovery and availability of new dilatory tools were positive incentives for us in opposition to use instead of a debate to communicate our concerns about the legislative proposal. However, in 1987 you intervened, Mr. Speaker, to remove that temptation from us.
Consider, though, that the unilateral changes to the Standing Orders and easy use of closure are now positive incentives to governments to use those tactics instead of negotiation and consensus building. It is not appropriate that the Chair similarly intervenes now and removes that temptation as it did earlier. Just as it saved us from ourselves, so to speak, in 1987 is it not time now to save the government from itself and save the institute from the abuse of rules by either side?
In conclusion, I simply want to say that I am asking the Chair to refuse to accept the time allocation motion until there has been more debate on the bill or until the motion is amended to provide further debate. I ask that the Chair ensure that the debate on Bill C-91 provides an examination of each of the key elements of the bill. In short, I ask the Chair to take whatever measures it

Government Orders
deems necessary to restore fair play and common sense to these proceedings.

My colleague made reference to the Chair's decision of 1987. At that time I was the critic for the Official Opposition regarding Bill C-22 and the government House leader was the minister responsible. However, it should be noted in the record that at report stage there are 73 amendments before us and we are now on amendment No. 1. It is very difficult in view of the interest that has been expressed, not only by members of the opposition but by members of the government, that we have a thorough airing of all those amendments to give each and every one an opportunity to express ourselves with regard to this particular provision.
In conclusion, at the committee stage there were a few witnesses but there could have been more witnesses in terms of number, and discussion could have been more extensive if the government had seen its way to elaborate further at committee stage.
I hope the Chair will give serious consideration to the point of order which has been raised, not allow this time allocation, and fall back on the principle which the Chair has used and demonstrated repeatedly in this House; namely, a measure of fairness for all members of Parliament regardless of their political persuasion to have an opportunity to put their views on the record on a subject matter which is important, not only in terms of the aspects of intellectual property, but also as it affects our health care and as it affects consumers in this country.
I hope, Mr. Speaker, you will give due consideration to this worthy point of order.

To suggest that Standing Order 78(3) is somehow an invention of this government is to misrepresent the situation.
Finally, the hon. House leader of the Liberal Party raises a point that I think we do need to consider. That is the 73 report stage amendments.
We have to consider it in this context. The intent of the rule changes that were brought in was that legislation would be given second reading in the House, it would go to committee for detailed study, come back for report stage and third reading. The intent was that amendments to bills should be discussed in committee. There they could be looked at in detail, they could be discussed, debated, voted on and dealt with.
The practice which is observed here is that the opposition members on the committee simply refuse to allow the putting of any amendments, wanting to bring them into the House, thereby negating the value of the committee study as it is currently structured.
We might want to look at some changes to our Standing Orders to make committee study much more useful of members' time than it is currently turning out to be because of the practices that are being used.

In conclusion, I repeat that any reasonable person will find that proper procedures have been followed.

I was a member here when certain rule changes were brought in. At that time Parliament did live and there was honest debate on controversial subjects. Mr. Speaker, as you undoubtedly know, and certainly the Table will know, the government House leader is right on the last part of what he said.
Now that I am on the opposition side, I wonder about moving amendments in committee because then you cannot move them in the House where you get the attention.
I never agreed more with the hon. member for Kamloops than on this issue. This bill was introduced on June 23, the day the House of Commons adjourned for the summer recess, and notwithstanding what was said by my hon. friend and former brotherly-like comrade, the member for Etobicoke, who talked about the summer, we all know that this past summer was involved in constitutional discussion.
Parliament came back on September 17 and that is when debate first started on second reading for one hour and 50 minutes.
We then adjourned because of the referendum, which was a unique period in Canadian history when the focus was on the Constitution and what was happening to Canada. There was no attention at all to the drug patent bill.
We had the referendum. We all know the results of October 26. This Parliament came back on November 16 and the bill was discussed for two days. Closure was put on the first day of debate, November 16, after two hours and 25 minutes of debate. The second day, November 17, debate was for three or four hours, for a total-and the government House leader has it wrong, to be fair-of eight hours and 40 minutes of debate at second reading of Bill C-91.
Mr. Speaker, in the sense of Parliament that used to be, if there ever was a bill that needed more focus from Canadians without the distractions, important as the Constitution was, that is Bill C-91. If the government is

December 9, 1992
Government Orders
so convinced of its case, why is it so scared to have parliamentary debate in this open forum?
In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the opposition House leader said-and I know there are some games played here-that with 73 amendments, how in all sense of parliamentary tradition can they be discussed fully. We are not England where we know the longest debate was for two days on the European Common Market. In this country we are spread out and we need time to debate in this forum, if it means anything, to find out if people from coast to coast still believe in any of the issues we debate.
Debate cannot be choked off after three days between a September day when we were involved in the Constitution and then coming back here in the post-constitution hangover that the member for High River still has. There were two days of debate on November 16 and 17. Does the House think this is long enough for an honest debate on something that affects Canadians from coast to coast? Every Canadian takes drugs and patent medicine and pharmaceutical drugs and it is fundamentally important we examine this thoroughly. If there were ever a reason to support the unusual and unique motion of the member for Kamloops, if this Parliament is to mean anything, then this is the time for you, Mr. Speaker, a person equal among all of us, to exercise your discretion in favour of Canadians, not just in the technical interpretation of rules.

However, we are somewhat surprised to hear the NDP complain indignantly about time allocation today, after having connived with the Liberal Party during the referendum debate to limit debate in order to prevent us from speaking out. When fighting for principles, you cannot act the martyr when, just a few months earlier, the very same principles were applied in reverse to limit debate.
In that sense, we can understand that the government would want to limit debate on this bill so vital to the Montreal area, as the NDP, by its attitude both in
committee and in this House, does not seem to want the debate to progress toward a conclusion and a vote. Without agreeing with the principle of time allocation, again we are surprised, considering the Liberals and the NDP had supported these very principles to limit us at the time of the referendum.

Some comments that I have made in the past have been quoted and I have listened very carefully to what I once said.
The difficulty it seems to me that those proponents of the motion are in is that, as the hon. House leader points out, there have been changes in the rules and the government has followed exactly the course it must follow under the present rules which govern us.
There has been some suggestion that when the present rules were past it was without the full consent of all the members in the House and that may well have been the case. The Speaker's area of manoeuvre in acting on discretion is always somewhat circumscribed and in this case it clearly is very much constrained.
I have to advise the House that in my view the government has followed exactly what the rules of the House are. As a consequence, while I have listened with great interest and some sympathy to the points made by members of the opposition, nonetheless I must rule that the matter can go forward.

I think it is important to reiterate what this bill is all about. It is not about extending patent protection for pharmaceutical drugs. It is about completely eliminating, for the entire 20-year patent period, the right of any generic manufacturer to produce a drug that is under patent and to compete with that drug on the open marketplace.
Not only are we completely eliminating a process of licensing generic drugs in the patent period and providing cheaper drugs for Canadians, but we are making it retroactive. This means that somebody, who a year ago had the right to produce a drug, will be told that that right was cancelled a year ago once this bill passes.
What is the impact going to be? The impact for Canadians is going to be higher drug costs. Right now, generic drugs being produced while the original is still under patent cost 53 per cent of the cost of the patent drug. That is a saving of 47 per cent for Canadian consumers.
Who benefits from this? The patent drug companies benefit from this. I will give just one example. The changes brought on with this legislation to one drug company will mean $1.3 billion. That is just from making this provision retroactive and preventing competition with one of their drugs in the marketplace.
One would think from what we have been hearing from the representatives of the drug manufacturers that generics were undermining the market and threatening to destroy the whole industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Generic drugs account for only 8 per cent of the market leaving fully 92 per cent of the market to the patent drug manufacturers who claim they need the protection and the extended rights that this legislation provides. Not only that, but this patent drug industry is the most profitable industry in the Canadian economy and in the American economy.
I think we have to ask who pays for these great gains. As I said, there are billions of dollars of revenue to be gained by the drug companies. Seniors will pay. Taxpayers will pay through medicare. Anybody who is too poor to have a drug plan or works for a company that does not have drug plan will pay. That usually means lower-paid
workers in our society. Every single taxpayer across this country will pay for the extra revenue and the extra profits to be generated for the drug companies that already represent the most profitable business in North America.
Insurance plans will pay. Many of us have plans that cover the cost of our drugs but those do not come without a cost either. Ultimately it is the medicare system that will pay.
We have growing concerns about the cost of our medicare system and anything that adds to that burden undermines continuing a universal accessible health care system for Canadians.
Four hundred million dollars a year is being saved by seniors, the poor, insurance companies, taxpayers and middle class taxpayers because we have generic drugs in this country.
We have heard fear-mongering that new drugs to serve the health needs of Canadians to cut our health care costs will not be produced if we do not pass this bill. What utter nonsense. Canada accounts for 2 per cent of the global patented drug market. Do not tell me that companies are not going to continue to produce drugs for the 98 per cent of the market.

Only 1 per cent of the new drugs developed are developed in Canada although we are 2 per cent of the market. Far fewer drug company profits go into research in Canada than in the United States and other countries around the world. We are getting half of our share of research. This is from an industry that five years ago said: ""Give us more of a free rein in the marketplace, remove our competition and we will do more in the way of research.""
What we have in Canada is branch plant drug companies. We do not have basic research. We do not have the kind of foundation that this country wants to see in this industry that is the most profitable in our economy and it does not deserve the kind of protection that this Conservative government is now proposing to offer.
December 9, 1992

It is really astonishing to see this bill coming forward from a Conservative government. What is it talking about? This is the government that talks about free market. This is a bill that limits competition. It says that for 20 years one does not have to compete against anybody else.
It is offering the patent drug companies a protected market for 20 years. This is the government that talks about competitiveness. How can competitiveness flourish, however, when rules change in the middle of a game? A company that a year ago was able to produce a drug is told now that despite the money invested in getting that drug ready to come on the market, it is not going to be able to do that because the rules have changed and they have changed retroactively.
We talk about fairness. The generic companies now have permission to produce 22 patent drugs that will not come on the market and will not compete with patented drugs because this government is saying that the rules of the game are changing. The change goes back to last year. We are removing the permission to provide 22 different drugs at a lower cost to Canadians.
We talked about honesty. There is no honesty in the debate on this bill. It is not extending patent protection, it is entirely removing the right of any company to produce generic drugs as long as the patent lasts.
It is not true that GATT requires us to do this. The proposed changes to GATT have not even been approved. Even if approved they would allow one year for a country to act and even after that year there is no certainty that Canada would have to take this kind of action.
It is not true that NAFTA requires us to do this. How could NAFTA require us to do this when NAFTA has not even been introduced in this Chamber? It has not yet been debated and has not been approved.
Government Orders
If NAFTA tells us what we can and cannot do to provide health care for Canadian citizens then we do not need NAFTA. That is just one more reason to vote against it.
I want to say a few final words about the corruption I have seen in people's integrity around this issue. This government attempted to suppress a report from its own officials that showed what this bill would do to drug prices in Canada, a report that said that patent protection was not producing research now and would not in the future. The report by our government officials would have led us to the conclusion that we should be cancelling the 1987 Bill C-22 that extended patent protection rather than making it absolute as this bill proposes to do.
I and every member of this House resent it when officials are told not to tell the truth, when they are brought before a committee of Parliament and gagged, when they are prevented from telling the truth about the scientific and analytical work they have done.
With all the money that is being spent on lobbying for this bill, we must ask who gains and who loses. Those who gain are the most profitable industries in this country. Those who lose are seniors, the poor, and the taxpayers, those least able to afford to pay to increase those profits.
To conclude, I do not think that we are here as government and as Parliament, to benefit the most profitable segment of our economy at the expense of those least able to pay.

It is well known that this bill has generated considerable controversy and goes back to Bill C-22. You will recall the uproar, both in the House and in the Senate, surrounding the passage of Bill C-22 which paved the way for the present situation allowing us now to strengthen the protection granted to companies involved in research.
The government is aiming at striking a balance between economic growth and consumer protection. Bill C-91 builds on the 1987 amendments to the Patent Act called, as I already mentioned, Bill C-22.

December 9, 1992
Government Orders
In 1987 the government took the first steps to stem the exodus of researchers and manufacturers who were deserting the Canadian drug industry in droves for a more welcoming climate. The 1987 amendments to the Patent Act were aimed at developing a policy favourable to research and innovation while protecting consumer interests.
As you know, Madam Speaker, it is essential to reward research if we want to promote a strong economy at a time where technological expertise and international competition are forever growing.
In other words, we want to keep drug developers in Canada in order to increase our research and technology capacity here and not elsewhere. We want companies to stay in Canada so that they employ our science graduates, invest in plant and equipment on Canadian territory, invest in research in universities, hospitals and other research centres, and export from Canada instead of importing from abroad. These are the objectives we want to achieve, together with a solid mechanism to control the price of patented medicine.
We never wanted to stimulate unbridled growth of the drug industry at consumers' expense. The spirit of our policy in 1987, as today, was to guarantee tight control of patented medicine prices so that the prices paid by Canadian consumers remain reasonable. We obtained this guarantee with the 1987 amendments, thanks to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. This board has done its duty and with the present bill, it will have more power.
Bill C-91 will authorize the board to reduce prices that are considered too high and to impose fines and prison terms on those who refuse to comply with its directives.
Detailed calculations allow us to predict that thanks to this new legislation, the amount spent by pharmacies and hospitals to buy all prescription and controlled drugs should not increase by more than 2 per cent a year from now until the year 2000.
Furthermore, between 1992 and 1996, thanks to Bill C-91, the total increase in the cost of patented medicine is estimated at $129 million, or approximately $25 million per year, which comes to $1 a year for every Canadian. I do not think that is too much to pay for a policy that stimulates research and development.
Thanks to this bill, Canada will reap the benefits of almost half a billion dollars more in investment by the innovative drug industry in the foreseeable future. That is a real balance between promoting economic growth and protecting consumers. Our achievements since 1987 attest to that.
Since 1987, the amendments to the Patent Act, better known as C-22, have borne fruit and their success continues to this day. Remember the criticism that the opposition Liberal Party and New Democratic Party made then. First, they maintained that the innovative drug industry would not keep the promises of investment that it had made to the government. Second, they said that the government would not be able to keep the price of patented medicine down; and third, that it would mean the end of generic drugs.
I would like to report on each of these issues. Concerning the first one, investment in research, the innovative drug industry has reached the promised objectives by doubling investment in research as a percentage of sales and it did this five years ahead of schedule.
This same industry has invested over a billion dollars in research and development in Canada over the last five years; $340 million went to universities, hospitals and other medical research establishments.
As for the second controversial issue, drug prices, the average annual increase in the price of existing patented medicine was about 2.9 per cent from 1987 to 1991. In the same period, the consumer price index rose 4.4 per cent a year. The increase was thus less than inflation between 1987 and 1991. This is an example of effective control of drug prices that completely refutes the objections raised in 1987 and should also make our opponents today think.
Other countries find that our drug price control system works. A study by the United States General Accounting Office on the price of 200 best-selling prescription drugs published in October showed that prices were about 32 per cent higher in the United States than in Canada. Half of the 200 drugs in the study cost wholesalers at least 50 per cent more in the United States; 27 per cent of these best-selling drugs cost wholesalers at least 100 per cent more in the U.S.; four of the ten most popular prescription drugs in the United States cost between 59 per cent and 278 per cent more in that country.
December 9, 1992

The American study concluded that one of the main causes of the price difference between the two countries was that the Canadian government had taken action, as the report says: ""In setting their prices, Canadian manufacturers of patented drugs must comply with Canadian federal regulations controlling the price of new medication and increases in the price of existing drugs.""
Obviously the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board has done a good job and our policy works. As for the third issue, the alleged disappearance of the generic drug industry in Canada, that has not happened. That industry has grown twice as fast as the pharmaceutical industry as a whole since 1987. Here again, the critics were wrong, and if they continue to use the same arguments today to oppose Bill C-91 they will be wrong again.
This legislation enables us to strike the balance that we sought between two important factor: on one hand, consumer protection is maintained through strict price regulation; and on the other, we have a healthy, vigorous, competitive drug industry, which is precisely the type of knowledge-based industry that Canada needs for its future.
We have succeeded in every respect with price control and a policy that welcomes investment. Today we ask the Liberal opposition and the New Democratic Party to co-operate, because our business people, our young university graduates and our young scientists need a law to protect their inventions. This is why we ask all members to pass this bill as quickly as possible, particularly to help the economic situation in Montreal and in Quebec.

of the basic articles of faith of any parliamentary system is that the government tries to tell the truth and to give to its citizens a fair and accurate appraisal of important matters in front of it so that the people will at least have the right to make a choice as to the legitimacy of legislation, good or bad, based upon legitimate facts.
We have been told that the reason for Bill C-91 is that it must be in full accordance with international treaties being initiated by this government, particularly the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs and the North American free trade agreement.
Government Orders
In particular, it has tried to justify the retroactivity clause by saying that we had to go back and meet the new GATT laws.
What it did not say is that there is not yet a new GATT law. There is a set of proposals being discussed but it has not been agreed to, and if the French farmers have anything to do with it, it will probably never be agreed to. That is in the realm of speculation.
What is more dangerous and I think more erosive of the principles of this House is that even in that proposed GATT agreement there is no requirement, no hard and fast rule, that a country abandon its compulsory licensing provisions.
For the Minister for International Trade to go on to the lecterns of this country, trying to sell this legislation on the basis that somebody made him do it over in Geneva is pure, unadulterated hogwash.
Article 30 of the proposed GATT agreement, page 70 reads: ""Parties may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interest of the patent owner taking account the legitimate interests of third parties"".
In other words, according to article 3 three of the GATT proposal that is now being said as being the compelling reason why we must do Bill C-91, the Canadian government could properly argue that any drug monopoly will have a severe impact on the Canadian health care system, third parties such as seniors or sick people, and therefore have a legitimate reason for applying for an exemption under the GATT. Anybody who says differently is not telling the truth, is misleading Canadians and is attempting to bias the debate in this country to serve a particular purpose.
That is not even enough. Let us go to article 31(b) of the proposed GATT agreement and see how ironclad an obligation this is. I have the agreement here if anybody wants to read it. It is only about 400 pages long. I am going to read the quote directly:
""Where the law of a party allows for the other use of subject matter of a patent without authorization of the right holder, including use by the government or third parties, the following provision shall be respected: such use may only be permitted if part of such use the proposed user has made efforts to obtain authorization and this requirement may be waived by a party in the case of a national emergency or other circumstances of

December 9, 1992
Government Orders
extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use"".
What is the public health care system of Canada if not a public non-commercial use? Do we not have a public health care system province by province? Is it not designed to ensure that all Canadians receive fair and equal medical treatment at the lowest cost possible? Does that not become fair, honest, serious grounds for exemption under the proposed GATT proposal? Of course it does.
We continue to have the voices of deception in this country led by this government trying to sell it as if somehow we must yield to some kind of holy obligation. If you go back to article 8 of the GATT agreement, in terms of setting out general principles: ""Parties may, in formulating or amending their national laws or regulations in relation to patent law, adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development"".
That is the basic principle of the GATT agreement, that we have a right to defend our public health and our socio-economic system.
I charge this government, with no uncertainty, of misleading Canadians by saying that we need Bill C-91 and that we need the retroactive clause to meet the GATT agreement. It is simply not the truth. It is about time the Minister for International Trade owned up to fact he can no longer tell the truth because he no longer understands what it is.

Therefore, any validity or credibility this government had that is prepared to defend the public interest of Canada gets flushed down the tube by the very words of what it says it has to obey. It is heresy. The Conservatives are misinterpreting their responsibilities under the GATT rule.
The NAFTA agreement is the government's own concoction. The countries of the world did not come up with NAFTA. It is what the government is writing into it.
However, it was so stupid and so idiotic that it was prepared to sign an agreement that would allow the Mexicans to have an eight-year transition period for their own public drug companies but we could not bargain the same thing for ours.
It is incredible and it is unbelievable. Yet the Prime Minister and the minister of trade stomp across Canada saying: ""NAFTA is good for you"". Sure it is good for you. It is good for a $2 billion swallow of increased cost for you. It is good for their friends, it is good for their corporate buddies, and it is good for their allies. It may be good for getting them jobs after they get defeated but it sure is not good for the Canadian people.
That is the real reason. The real reason is not in the trade agreements. I will concede that when drafting NAFTA, in copying the GATT they tended to forget. They included the first part of the proposal, which requires the phasing out of compulsory licensing, but they did not live up to the honour and the word of the GATT proposal, which provided clear exemptions for compulsory licensing.

If they answered for the vagaries of all their former associates they would be attending parole board hearings every single day of the year.
Let us not use that as an excuse. Let us get down to the merits of the case. There is nothing under GATT that would require Canada to implement Bill C-91. If there was any court of justice that required some sense of veracity and verity from a minister, the Minister for International Trade would be given the longest sentence possible.
He would be incarcerated for the rest of his life, because he has told the biggest whopper which has cost Canadians more money than any criminal we could possibly imagine. It is a bigger heist than the Brinks robbery, to use that argument.

The whole reality of what we are debating disappears. It vanishes. It is not there. It is ephemeral. It is made up. It is a fantasy. That is why we are simply saying that they cannot with any honesty justify this proposal with those arguments.
We must restore a sense of trust in Canadians so they can feel that their members of government and Parliament are at least prepared to deal with the truth. I would say there is only one way to restore credibility, and that is to withdraw Bill C-91 and make a serious examination of how Canada can live up to its proper international obligations and at the same time use the law as it has been proposed to ensure that we protect the public health and the public interest of the Canadian people.

Bud Bird (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,MEASURE TO AMEND,,"Mr. Speaker, throughout all the debates on this bill we must not overlook or minimize the fact that one of the fundamental objectives of this legislation concerns questions of protection and of rewarding people's investments in discovery.
In essence, that is what the patent protection bill is all about. Bill C-91 will help us open doors to world markets, contributing to the stimulation of this country's economy. As Professor Labrie of Laval University said so effectively in his presentation before the legislative committee last week: ""We will have to adapt as quickly as possible to the rules of world-wide markets before all the seats are taken by others who have reacted more quickly and more vigorously than us"".
He went on to say that: ""While Canada's medical sector is recognized internationally for its excellence, opportunities will be largely lost if its work cannot be translated into economic spin-offs for exports and into the new drugs needed by Canadians for better health care"".
Bill C-91 is very much a question of encouraging and recognizing discovery. It is also very much a question of fairness. We have spoken at length about protecting the consumer through strong patented drug price controls and of encouraging investments in a high technology industry with the resulting benefits of job creation and export development potential.
Government Orders
However, the whole question of fairness and recognition for innovation is also very important to the government, and it should be just as important to the people of this country.
It is the government's belief that innovation deserves to be recognized. If there is no protection or reward for such effort, that effort will eventually stagnate or move to where it is recognized. We well know that Canada lags behind all of its major international competitors in the patent protection it accords to pharmaceutical products.
Even though the full patent term award is 20 years, we must not lose sight of the fact that the period of actual product development testing, et cetera for new medicine comprises roughly 10 of those 20 years. Although that leaves 10 years for the marketing of that product under patent protection, present legislation permits others to copy the medicine after it has been on the market for only about seven of those ten years.
Consequently, while a company has a patent on a product for the last three years of that patent period somebody else can copy it and market it under a compulsory licence.
This seven-year period of market exclusivity in Canada lags behind that of the United States, where it is 14 years. It lags behind those of countries in Europe, where market exclusivity of pharmaceutical products is 15 years. Our regime of patent protection for pharmaceuticals, featuring compulsory licensing with a period of market exclusivity of only about seven years compared to these much longer periods elsewhere, simply does not measure up. Canada is losing out because of it.
Bill C-91 will go a long way toward changing that situation. This legislation will add on average about three years to the period of market exclusivity in Canada. It does not add 20 years to the period of market exclusivity-or 10 years or whatever other number of years critics across the way are saying it adds-it simply adds about three years of market exclusivity to the patented pharmaceutical product.
By doing that the legislation brings the Canadian drug patent regime closer to those of our international competitors so that Canada can once again compete for research and development projects, and particularly for investment dollars.

December 9, 1992
Government Orders
Although the practice of protection of intellectual property may seem to be a complicated affair the reasons behind it are really very simple when we strip away the legalese and the jargon. It is a straightforward affair. It stimulates invention and new technology. It recognizes people for developing a better mousetrap, except in this case we are not talking about mouse traps but about new medicines and new cures for treatments of ailments and diseases that afflict Canadians and people throughout the world.
Without patents on those inventions there really would be little motivation for people to develop those inventions. Why should someone invest years of effort and large sums of money when others can copy the work of the inventor with no obligation? In this situation, people will stop inventing and people will stop investing.
By adopting this legislation, we will be providing the pharmaceutical sector in Canada with the same conditions of patent protection as are available to all other sectors of our Canadian economy. As it is now, pharmaceutical inventions are not treated the way that inventions in other sectors of the economy are treated. For example, the patent for a new plastic compound receives full market exclusivity for the patent holder for 20 years.
Why not the same for the developer or the creator of a new medicine? We should all agree that it is only fair that all sectors of the economy should be treated the same way when it comes to recognition for a discovery.
That is the major reason we are going forward with Bill C-91. I urge this House to adopt the bill. It is good for Canada, it is good for Canadians.

Just who are these people? A veritable who's who, no doubt: Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Monsanto, and Procter & Gamble. There is absolutely no doubt they are the poor people on the block. There is an old saying: ""A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down"". Well, this is a poison pill for Canadians across this country. A report in the 1960s said that drug prices in Canada were among the highest
in the world. They corrected the problem. Now we are in a situation where the drug companies have reduced the price of drugs by 20 per cent and sometimes 30 per cent. They are saying: ""That is not good. We have to jack those prices up and make them more expensive"".
The member from Winnipeg talked about GATT. That is important. That is the legal slant on this particular bill and what the government has put forward as its argument. It has been proven to be fallacious. The average Canadian no doubt has a difficult time understanding what GATT is and some of us in these seats have difficulty understanding it also.

After investigating, we asked: ""What is the difference"". The toothless Prices Review Board said: ""Well, they are under investigation right now"". The details of that investigation given to me revealed that they had repackaged the drug. ""It is a new improved drug with better results, therefore, we have to increase the price of the drug 12 times.""
I cite from some of the actual statutes of the Prices Review Board. The first consists of new strengths of an existing dosage form or comparable dosage form of an existing drug product, a line extension. The second includes drug products that constitute a substantial improvement over other drugs because of significant improvements in the therapeutic effects or important savings to the Canadian health care system. It is impossible to document, therefore, the Prices Review Board says: ""There is not really anything we can do. We will have to allow the prices to increase tenfold, twelvefold and there is not a darned thing we can do about it"".

Who is to prove how much more substantial a new product or an old product under a new disguise or a new camouflage is going to be for people.

The constituent says: ""I cannot afford the $100 a month to pay for the drug bill"". Who is at fault? I suspect the people at the top are at fault, but the person at the bottom of the heap always pays the price.
These are drugs that are absolutely essential to these people; life-threatening without them and they cannot afford to pay $100 a month. We can talk about GATT, NAFTA, free trade, patents and compulsory licences, but the bottom line is that average Canadians will pay considerably more. Really, once the bill is passed we will never know because there will be no effective police individual to look after the interests of Canadians.

world respect each other's patent legislation the same as they respect each other's copyright legislation.
If it is too difficult for the member to follow in terms of patents maybe we could talk about something as easy as copyright. An Anne Murray produces a record in Canada and would like to get royalties when her records and CDs are played in the United States. We recognize other countries' patent legislation and copyright legislation, and they respect ours.
If Canada is the only industrialized country in the world that does not have 20-year patent legislation, then why would other countries want to respect our patents?
The world has become a global community and if we do not respect the patent legislation of other countries, they certainly will not respect ours. If we are going to short-cut the system, if we are going to peel off a couple of extra years, kind of cheat the international system, abrogate GATT and other international agreements, then pretty soon other nations are going to start looking at Canada as they look at some banana republic that does not respect patent legislation anywhere in the world, that does not respect copyright legislation. That is only one point I wanted to mention.
He also talked about this era of investment that began in 1987. I would like to take a look at that era of investment and how it has not started today with the announcement of a $170 million research and development program in his area, but how it has been happening all across this country for the past four years, and how it will continue.
In 1987 Parliament passed Bill C-22, an act to strengthen the pharmaceutical patent legislation. At that time there was a furore over its implementation and the perceived effect it would have on Canadian research and development, drug prices and the generic drug manufacturers, the same kind of hullabaloo that we are hearing from the opposition today.
I would like to go over with members what type of research and development has occurred in Canada since 1987 and what the industry plans to achieve over the next three to four years.
In 1987, as part of the implementation of Bill C-22, the innovative drug companies promised to double the research and development to sales ratio to 10 per cent by 1996 if the country improved patent protection.
Mr. Speaker, Canada did. We passed Bill C-22 and the companies more than delivered on their promises. They essentially met their commitment by 1991, five years ahead of schedule, doubling their research and development expenditures in Canada.
The question that many Canadians may ask, however, is how much of this investment went to the regions of Canada? Was it all in central Canada, or were there jobs in research and development for the regions? Also, are there likely to be benefits for the regions in the future as part of the new legislation being debated?
As I mentioned earlier, it is apparent that the patent pharmaceutical manufacturers have more than delivered on their 1987 promise. The innovative industry has spent close to $1.1 billion on research and development in Canada since the Patent Act amendments of 1987. In 1991 alone, a year of recession in this country, research spending by innovative pharmaceutical companies totalled $376 million, a 23 per cent increase over 1990.
How many other industries in Canada saw such a growth in capital investment in that same period? It is readily apparent that the Canadian pharmaceutical industry is a Canadian success story that government should applaud and assist. In doing so, the industry will be encouraged to spread its success to all regions of Canada in an environment of co-operation and achievement.
These achievements have already begun to pay dividends in the regions of Canada that in the past were not traditional centres for investment in research and development.
Since 1987 and the revisions to the Patent Act, the innovative companies have created 2,400 jobs in Canada. These jobs are quality, long-term jobs that the regions of this country need to diversify and strengthen their resource-based economies. These jobs also attract the best students and professors for the universities that want to expand their horizons into the high-tech world of pharmaceutical development.
Perhaps the best way to understand what the effect of Bill C-22 has had on areas outside of central Canada is to examine the amount of investment into research and development that has occurred in these areas since its implementation. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board has reported that in the period 1988-91 industry investment in research and development in Manitoba

showed a 119 per cent increase. That is why the hon. member for Winnipeg South supports the bill.

In B.C. the increase in investment was 72 per cent. In my own province of Alberta, a leader in pharmaceutical research, current investment is at record levels, a point which I will dwell on a little further in a moment.
These numbers dramatically demonstrate that the innovative pharmaceutical manufacturers have spread their research and development spending across the country in a fashion unlike any other sector. The research community in the regions of Canada recognize the importance of this new legislation in order to foster an investment climate that will promote research and development, and the people across Canada recognize the importance of this legislation. I am sure that each of them hopes that new investment will find its way to laboratories and research facilities in their part of the country.
An important question for the people outside of central Canada concerns the ramifications for then-economies if this legislation is not passed in the coming weeks.
The passing of this legislation is directly linked to job creation over the coming years in regions across the country.
On June 14, 1992 Bristol-Myers, Squibb announced that it would be spending $250,000 on a research and development project at the University of Alberta, and on October 6, Glaxo announced it would spend $15 million at the University of Alberta. The people of Alberta understand; they know this development research money is going to our universities creating jobs in Alberta.
On July 15, Bristol-Myers, Squibb announced it would spend $500,000 on research and development at the University of British Columbia.
Government Orders
On September 1, 1992 Merck Frosst Canada Inc. announced it would spend $15 million on research at the University of British Columbia.
On October 5,1992 Ayerst announced it would build a new $60 million plant in Brandon, Manitoba. These are the types of announcements that the people in the regions of this country want to hear and they know the long-term benefits for both jobs and the health of their communities.
The Canadian Genetic Diseases Network is one of 15 research networks sponsored by the Government of Canada's $240 million Network of Centres of Excellence program. It has already announced remarkable breakthroughs in isolating the genetic defects responsible for cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy.
I do not think there is a person in this room who does not think that this important work needs to be done on an urgent basis to save the lives of people with these crippling diseases.
This work is also likely to create 10 new faculty positions at UBC, representing a tremendous opportunity for researchers in Canada. They will become involved in leading edge research and development in one of the most exciting areas of science and technology.
I have spent a lot of time discussing what effect this legislation will have on western Canada but I can assure the House that the same sort of optimism exists in the east in Atlantic Canada.
As recently as December 2, 1992 Marion Merrell Dow (Canada) Inc. announced it was going to establish a cardiac prevention research centre at Dalhousie University. This centre is funded in its entirety by Marion Merrell Dow, one of Canada's largest innovative pharmaceutical companies.
It is hoped that the work conducted at the cardiac prevention research centre will lead to effective prevention programs in the fight against coronary heart disease.

Government Orders
The provincial minister of health in Nova Scotia, the Hon. George Moody, has stated of the centre:
Marion Merrell Dow is one of the first pharmaceutical companies
to recognize the leadership role of Dalhousie in health research. The
initiative is a direct investment in the future health of our province.
All regions of this country support the type of research and investment, ongoing commitment which can better the health of all Canadians.
In conclusions, the reasons why I support Bill C-91 are clear. It is good for Canada, good for the Canadian health research and development and good for the regions of this country.

The members of this House will remember very well the hue and cry of the opposition back then that the sky would fall on consumers and on the generic drug sector if Bill C-22 were passed.
It was also predicted back then that the promises of investment if we reinstated the patent protection for pharmaceuticals on the part of the innovative companies would not be kept.
Critics claim loudly and vigorously by that the powers of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board would never be sufficient to control patent drug prices. Strangely enough, most of the same claims can be heard today from the opposition concerning Bill C-91. Bill C-22 has been a great success story. There is no reason for Bill C-91 to be any different.
The innovated companies have met the commitments the government asked of them in 1987. In some areas they have done better than they committed to do. There is no reason to doubt that they will carry through on their new investment promises related to the announcement of the government's new policy, with such planned investments totalling over $500 million to date and still counting.

It is very unfair for the member to stand up and do what he has just done. He has been around here a lot longer than I have and I think in fairness he realizes that very seldom in debate do I have to step through the facts and figures as clearly as I have to tonight. It is very important that the facts and only the facts be laid on the line tonight. That is what I will attempt to do.
In 1987 the innovative drug companies promised to double their research and development spending in a ratio of sales of 10 per cent by 1996 if the government improved patent protection. Canada did and the companies more than delivered on their promises. They essentially met their commitment by 1991, five years ahead of schedule.
The innovative industry has spent close to $1.1 billion on research and development in Canada since the Patent Act amendments of 1987. In 1991 alone, a year of recession, in this country and others as well research spending by innovative pharmaceutical companies totalled $376 billion, a 23 per cent increase over 1990. How many other industries in Canada saw such growth in
December 9, 1992

their capital expenditures? I do not think too many of them did.
The pharmaceutical industry in Canada is a success story of which we should very proud. The highest increase in house R and D expenditures of all industries in Canada over the period of 1988 to 1992 was achieved by the pharmaceutical industry; a 113 per cent growth, according to Statistics Canada in a report published in 1992. Spending on R and D by the pharmaceutical companies or the industry as a per cent of sales is five times greater than Canada's manufacturing industry.
Since the 1987 revisions of the Patent Act, the innovative companies have created 2,400 jobs in Canada. The system that has been in place since 1987 has worked very well on the economic development score.
Another concern of the opposition in 1987 were drug prices and the controls upon those prices. Bluntly put, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board was set up in Bill C-22. It was not supposed to work according to the critics, but it has. There is no reason to believe that the board with its expanded powers under Bill C-91 will not continue to effectively control the prices of patented medicines in the future.
Let me put the board's role in perspective. The board is responsible only for patent drug price changes. Where the board does have jurisdiction it has been extremely effective. Since its creation in 1987, price increases for existing patent drugs have risen by an average of only 2.9 per cent a year while the consumer price index has risen by an average of 4.4 per cent. Therefore, we have kept patent drug price increases well below the rate of inflation and we will continue to do so. This is a very strong record of effectively controlling patent drug prices and it completely discredits the criticisms of 1987 as well as those today regarding Bill C-91.
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident to others in the world that our system of drug price control works. A recent study by the General Accounting Office of the United States government, looking at the pricing of the 200 biggest selling medicines in the U.S., established that the wholesale drug prices in Canada were 32 per cent lower on average than those in the United
Government Orders
States. Interestingly enough, the opposition never mentions that.
One-half of the drugs studied cost wholesalers at least 50 per cent more in the United States. Of the 200 top selling drugs, 27 of them cost wholesalers at least 100 per cent more in the United States. Three drugs cost at least 500 per cent more in the United States. Furthermore, 4 of the 10 top selling drugs in the United States cost between 59 per cent and 278 per cent more in the United States than in Canada.
Since there are no differences in manufacturers' costs in the two countries, the study concluded that the major source of the difference in drug prices between the United States and Canada is to be found in the actions of the Canadian government through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. This is a board that we set up. It relies on provincial formularies with their concentrated purchasing power to refuse to list overpriced medicines.
Clearly the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board is doing its job. To make sure it continues to do its job, Bill C-91 will strengthen and expand its powers.
Another element of the doomsday scenario of the critics of this bill and our patent drug bill in 1987 had to do with the supposed disappearance of the generic pharmaceutical manufacturing sector in Canada. The generic sector grew rapidly in the years preceding 1987. It followed the policy which the previous government instituted in 1969 to allow any company to license a patent product from a brand name company in exchange for a 4 per cent royalty fee.
This policy, although it led to the creation of a growing sector of companies that copied products developed by others, caused the international innovative sector in Canada to look for more welcome homes elsewhere. They looked in other countries in search of protection for their inventions and research efforts.
Bill C-22 was meant to reverse the outflow of economic activity away from Canada in an industry with a strong scientific and manufacturing heritage in this country. The intent of Bill C-22 was to reinstate a policy of recognizing discovery and rewarding innovation while balancing that with the protection of the interests of consumers.

Bob Kaplan (York Centre):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,MEASURE TO AMEND,,"Mr. Speaker, we are here speaking on a closure motion. I would like to begin by saying that if there ever was a demonstration of the smash and grab tactic used by this government, then this is it. There has never been a bill of such major importance to so many millions of Canadians, especially the elderly and those in ill health, that has been pushed through so quickly. As so many speakers have noted, it has been pushed through quickly for no valid reason other than to make sure that as few waves as possible are made and that the Canadian people do not find out what this government is smashing and who is grabbing with this particular piece of legislation.
However, it is as my colleague, the member for Broadview-Greenwood who just spoke briefly, said. This is a time bomb because the effect of this bill will come through to the Canadian people and it will not be very many months before they realize how misleading the government has been in the statements that it has made about this bill.
One of the theme songs of this government and one of the lovely melodies that it has played time and time again as it has inflicted its philosophy on the Canadian people over the last eight years is harmonization. What a wonderful word.
What does the government mean by harmonization? It means that the United States of America is the big time. It is the one that knows how to do everything right. It is the one that knows how to run an economy. It is the one that knows how to run a society. We are a backwater where we do not know how to do anything right. The quicker the government can bring us into harmony with every practice and every melody of the United States, the happier it will be.
When it took over in 1984 it found Canada to be a sheltered workshop. This was a place where we took care
of each other. This was a place where we were prepared to interfere in the way the market operated. This was a place where one did not have to show one's credit card to get admitted into a hospital and did not have to pay for drugs if one was covered by some public programs as well as by the many private programs that existed.
The government's philosophy has been-in every area and as fast as it could-to bring us into line with the way they do it in the wonderful country to the south. That includes health care.
I heard a number of speakers in tonight's debate say: ""We are the odd man out. We cannot be the odd man out. We cannot do things our own way"". What makes us think that we are allowed to have a national health care program that works on our own terms, where its success has been proven and where its popularity with the Canadian people has been demonstrated every time it is challenged. This time the popularity will be challenged too.
""You odd man out, you Canada"", they have said to us, ""Get into line. Stop doing things your own way. Start doing things the way they are done in the United States"".
A number of speakers have said that intellectual property has to be encouraged and recognized. They are absolutely right. No one would want to bother inventing anything commercially and so on if there was not a reward for it. The question is how much of a reward should there be.
Our doctors practise medicine in this country at a great financial disadvantage compared to the United States. This is what we are told. The good ones could go to the United States and make a lot more money. Many do that. That has not stopped us from limiting the income for doctors and from saying: ""You've worked hard to become a doctor. You've exercised your profession with some skill. You deserve some recompense. You deserve, by the way, to be part of the highest paid occupation-by far-in our country"".
Under our present medicare system we say: ""However, there is a limit. You can't extra bill. You can't charge more than the tariff that we provide"". We accept that. Doctors seem to accept it. At least there is a line-up to get into every medical school in this country. It cannot be that terrible.

On the drug side, however, we are told that we are not allowed to do things in the Canadian way. We are not allowed to decide how much intellectual property should be rewarded.
I think, just like the doctors, people who invent drugs should be well paid. Prices charged for drugs should recognize there is a degree of innovation and incentive to be put into this system and that we want to encourage invention and discovery and all the rest of it. I think we do that in the system we have.
Compulsory licensing is not theft. Compulsory licensing is not piracy. Compulsory licensing is a Canadian way of compensating the drug companies in a way which has made them the most profitable manufacturing business in Canada over the last few years.
It is since we had compulsory licensing and since the Tories began to take it away. They threw it out. Like the doctors who are in the highest paid profession, the drug companies have been the highest paid manufacturing companies. I do not think they have any right to complain that there is something wrong with our system of rewarding intellectual property.
Of course they have a right to complain but I am disagreeing with their argument. I say they have not made a compelling case and they need us to move to what they call a favourable climate for doing more research and development.
I want to talk about that for a moment. I can hear the drug companies say: We cannot go on working in this country because we are at a disadvantage here. If our taxes were too high, if our labour laws were too onerous, if our environmental standards and our pollution standards were too high, but they are not complaining about any of those things.
Those are the factors of government policy on which they could legitimately complain if we were out of line. The way in which we reward patents has nothing to do with the incentive to do research and development in our country. If they invent or discover something here, they will get all the world's patent protection that they would get if they had invented it in the United States.
However, they would be subject in Canada to what Canadians, I believe, consider a fair and appropriate reward for what they do. Therefore, they cannot get
Government Orders
away with the argument that they need a more favourable climate to do research and development. It is baldly this: They are saying it is a sovereign Canada. We want a more favourable return if we are going to do research and development.
I know I do not have a lot more time, but I want to say a word about the significance of research and development. I think it is wonderful. It is great to have it going on in the country. It provides high paying jobs for a small number of our brightest Canadians who I am happy to encourage to stay in the country. We pay a lot to get that. As taxpayers, we put in a big subsidy and a big incentive for them.
If we were also to agree to this legislation, we would be giving them for the $500 million that is promised a very big return in the form of much higher drug prices, estimated by credible witnesses at about $7 billion. Maybe that figure is higher than the true figure, but the government is not willing to have an adequate debate about that.
Its smash and grab tactic is preventing us from really looking at the figures and deciding who is right and who is not. I would like to say one final thing about research and development. What we like about research and development is that if something is discovered, it will be manufactured here. Then there will be hundreds of jobs for other Canadians who are not university graduates, maybe, and who are not the brightest and the best who are doing the research.
It is kind of the front line for all the work that goes in behind successful research and development. However, those drug companies will not give that work to Canada. If anything was ever discovered here-I hope it is and things have been discovered here even while we have had compulsory licensing-by one of those international drug companies, it is going to be made in Puerto Rico, not in Canada.
In Puerto Rico, they have a deal where they do not pay any taxes at all on manufacturing that is done in the drug area. What is so exciting about getting this research and development here? Are we getting a commitment that if they discover anything, it is going to be made here? Absolutely not. Are we getting an iron clad commitment even that they will do more research and development? No, we are not.

Government Orders
We know that their business will expand in Canada in the future even if compulsory licensing continues because the market is growing. Our population is aging. More drugs and more things are being discovered. They need people here whether they like it or not just to process their applications to sell patent medicines in this country.

The government tabled its bill in the House of Commons on June 23, and on September 17 the bill was debated at second reading.
The time has come to put this legislation before both Houses of Parliament so that it can be passed and given Royal Assent, after third and final reading. To be able to operate on the same level as other industrialized countries, we must have legislation that is in line with today's modem legislation on intellectual property. We see the bill before the House today as one of the most advanced of its kind.
We have before us legislation that is designed to promote science and technology, the acquisition of marketable experience and the ability of our researchers to meet current challenges on international markets. Providing better patent protection will help us achieve these objectives.
We have here in Canada everything we need to play a leading role in pharmaceutical research. The standard of medicine in this country is well regarded. We have a health care system that is the envy of the entire world. We have a skilled labour force, and we are now doing everything that is necessary to enhance those skills. Our tax credits are among the most generous in the world.
However, until now, something essential was lacking. We needed protection for intellectual property that was in line with the protection offered in other industrialized countries: patent legislation that would make us better able to compete for investment in research and development.
Since 1984, the government has set a high priority on intellectual property legislation, reform as part of its efforts to provide for a dynamic economy.
Today I would like to give an overview of Bill C-91, to refresh our memories and urge all members of this House to support this bill unanimously. I will answer a number of fundamental questions. What kind of amendments are we proposing to the 1987 Patent Act? What will be the principal benefits of the new legislation? Will the Canadian public also benefit from these amendments? How will it make us better able to meet the challenges in the pharmaceutical sector, on Canadian and international markets?
By reinforcing the Patent Act, we want to promote investment in an advanced technology sector. We also want to make Canada better able to compete on international markets for pharmaceutical products. It is a sector in which competition is intense, and we must make up for lost time. I am not an alarmist, but I think we should realize that we are lagging behind and that we must act now.
With the new amendments, Canada will eliminate compulsory licensing and bring its patent system into line with those of its trading partners. That is one of the main points of the new legislation. Patent holders will, from now on, be guaranteed protection for 20 years, the same period granted patent holders in all other economic sectors.
The proposed legislation will be an incentive for Canadians to develop new drugs in Canada, thus making it possible to reduce health care costs in the long run, another important aspect of this bill.
We must not forget that in recent years innovative companies discovered and developed 32 new drugs in this country, including drugs to treat cancer, Parkinson's disease and diabetes.
Last year the innovative sector of the pharmaceutical industry spent $84 million on research in universities and hospitals. Since 1987, the last time the government improved protection for drug patents, the innovative industry, which now has 18,000 employees, created 2,400 new highly-skilled jobs.
In 1987 again, the innovative industry promised to double its ratio of R and D to sales by 1996, provided the government reinforced patent protection. As of 1991, nearly five years earlier than originally planned, this objective had almost been achieved by the industry.
December 9, 1992

I might add that since the government announced last January its intention to remove compulsory licensing, the innovative companies responded by promising to invest an extra $500 million in our country between 1992 and 1996, $90 million of which in areas outside of central Canada.
Basic research on pharmaceutical products accounts for over 26 per cent of the research and development done in this country, roughly the same as in other industrialized countries. Between 1987 and 1991 the innovators in the industry spent about $1.1 billion on research and development. Between 1988 and 1991 investments grew from $30.3 million to $94.2 million just for basic research.
On June 19, 1992, Statistics Canada reported that, between 1988 and 1992 the pharmaceutical industry had registered the highest rate of growth-113 per cent- among Canadian industries in terms of R and D investments.
New products will translate into substantial sales because of the global product mandating of companies in Canada. We are at the crossroads and this legislation comes just at the right moment, as the statistics I just quoted indicate.
World class innovative companies have already decided to grant new product mandates to their Canadian plants. New investments in R and D, new scientific and technical jobs, spin-offs for other industries and increased sales abroad add up to improved Canadian competitiveness on the global market.
With the elimination of compulsory licensing, the purchase price of all the prescribed drugs and scheduled drugs that hospitals and drugstores buy should not go up, at least not for the first year. On the other hand, and this deserves to be stressed, this increase in research leading to the development of new, more effective drugs is likely to bring health costs down in Canada, if combined with improved management practices.
On the latter subject, the federal and provincial health ministers are totally in agreement and are committed to working together toward this end.
I have heard opposition members say that government was proceeding too hastily. They seem to forget that we have some $500 million in investments at stake here. Innovative pharmaceutical companies have promised to spend that much when the government announced, last
Government Orders
January, that it was going to strengthen patent protection.
These investments are vital at a time when the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing restructuring. Many other countries would like to take advantage of such investments. As a matter of fact, if Canada does not act quickly enough, it may find this door now opening forever closed. That would be very detrimental to our country.
I see that my time is up.

Evidently those figures are wrong. They distort the facts. I cannot believe that the government would keep using these figures.
This bill is a disaster. It is a very bad bill for Canada and for Canadians. Canadians are once again being sold down the river by their government. It is not the first time it has happened with this government and I am sure it will not be the last.
Unfortunately the election has been deferred for a while. It appears we are going to have to suffer for some months longer with this continual sales job by the Government of Canadian interests to other foreign nationals.
Some people say in support of this bill that Canadians should pay their fair share. When I speak to my constituents who support this bill, and some do, they say to me that surely Canadians should pay their fair share. What constitutes a fair share? Why are drug prices in Canada so much higher than they are in Europe? Are Canadians not paying a fair price when we look at the European experience? Many of these drugs are made by multinationals with head offices in Europe.

December 9, 1992
Government Orders
Canadian drag prices are 32 per cent lower than American drag prices. Does that mean that our prices are somehow unfair? Does that mean because Americans are being gouged for their drags by the multinational drag companies that Canadians should pay more? Does that make it unfair that we are getting away with a bargain because we have different rales that apply to drag manufacturing in this country? I suggest it does not.
I suggest what is fair is determined by the marketplace. We have set up a system for Canadian manufacturers to get involved in the drag manufacturing process that is fair for Canadians. It creates jobs in Canada. It has created a large industry in this country that is flourishing. What this government wants to do is undermine the industry and transfer all the money to the big multinational drag companies.
That is what this bill is all about. It is unfair for Canadians that their government is the one so avidly supporting this at a time when it has no need to support it and when it has chosen to pull this policy out of the air for no apparent reason.
The minister cites these foreign agreements and says somehow Canada is bound by foreign agreements to do this. Not one of those agreements is in force yet. The GATT agreement under which this was a proposal has not been agreed to. The minister is prepared to give away anything in order to make a deal. He gives it away before he is at the negotiating table, which is a shocking way to carry on any negotiation.
We have seen it before. We have seen it in negotiations with the provinces. We have seen it in negotiations with the United States in the free trade deal. We have seen it in all kinds of negotiations it has carried on with its public servants. It is incapable of negotiating properly. It is incapable of governing and this bill is further evidence of that.
This bill gives $700 million to one company, Merck Frosst Canada, on sales of just one of its products. That is the estimate we have in respect of just one drug because of the extended patent protection.
Where is that money coming from? Out of the pockets of every Canadian. Canadian taxpayers will pay for it in
the government financed drag plans across this country, Canadian purchasers of drags who have to buy them out of their own pocket, and finally the buyers of medical and drag insurance who will have to pay increased premiums to cover the cost of these drags.

It is going to be a very significant additional cost. In some cases we have governments like the Government of Ontario that takes drags off the list so senior citizens have to buy the drags on their own. This is going to drive up their costs.
Who benefits from all this additional money, the $700 million that is taken out of Canadians' pockets? Who gets the money? The drag companies get the money. That is who. The international drag companies get the money.
Sure, they told us that if we pass this bill there will be another $500 million in investment in research and development in this country. That is great, but how much are Canadians going to pay in order to get the $500 million in research? The cost of the retroactive provisions of this bill alone are estimated at over $2 billion.
The hon. member for Winnipeg South says that is nonsense. The government figures that she has put forward are a fraud on the Canadian public. They amount to nothing but a fraud on the Canadian public. The government's estimate is $550 million. Two billion dollars is the estimate from respected international experts who know a lot more about the drag industry than the hon. member or any member of this government obviously does.
What this government sees is dollar signs for its friends. It flashes away and says: ""We will give you whatever you want"". That is what is going on in this bill.
Where is the guarantee that the $500 million will be invested in Canada? Where is the guarantee that any percentage of the extra funds generated for these drag companies will be invested in Canada? You will look through the bill in vain, Mr. Speaker. It is not there. There is no guarantee written into this legislation.
December 9, 1992

How much are Canadians going to pay for this research? On the retroactive provisions alone, $2 billion. That is $4 for every $1 of research guaranteed, and that is only the cost on the retroactive provisions. The estimate that Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer gave the other day was that this bill was going to cost something like $7 billion by 2010.
I think the hon. member was on the committee. She must know the figures. She says he trumped those up over a weekend. That is what she said in her speech the other day. I never heard such rubbish in my life.
The gentleman is a very capable expert, a professor of pharmaceutical economics and director of the Prime Institute of the College of Pharmacy. He knows more about drugs than everybody in this House put together. He says that is what the bill is going to cost.
The hon. member for Winnipeg South is clearly burying her head in the sand on this and trying to pretend that her government has not let her down again. She is wagging her head and mumbling from her seat, trying to tell me that the figures that this expert has quoted are wrong. She knows that this government has led her down the garden path again. She must have been embarrassed to make the speech she had to make yesterday, trying to discredit this expert and ignoring the facts on which we are basing our arguments that this whole bill and all the arguments government members have put forward in support of it are a fraud on the public. They are deceiving the Canadian public with their figures. They are wrong. They know they are wrong and they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting them forward.
Canadians are so badly served by the arguments put forward by this government on this bill that it amounts to another national disgrace.
The hon. member for Winnipeg South, in the course of her speech, wondered how anyone could know more about drugs than Canada's Public Service. She knows that her government has chopped the Public Service: cut, cut, cut. It has taken people out of the Public Service. It has driven good people out of the Public Service. The Public Service is hardly able to do the cost projections required in order to come up with figures to support the
Government Orders
government's arguments on this bill. They do not have the arguments. They do not have the figures, and the hon. member knows it.
The hon. member for London-Middlesex, in the course of his speech the other day, tried to let on that somehow I opposed research and development. That is absolute rubbish and it hardly bears answering. The hon. member for London-Middlesex who so rarely speaks here suddenly made a speech. Because I told him what he was saying was rubbish he went on to say that I was opposed to research and development.
I am not prepared to support research and development when we are paying billions and billions for peanuts. That is what the hon. member is doing. She is going to have Canadians pay $7 billion in exchange for $500 million in research. She will not even put a guarantee in the bill that the $500 million will be spent. I urge her to read Bill C-91 before she speaks again and see exactly what it says. She will find out there are no guarantees in the bill and then maybe she will not be talking through her hat.
Finally I want to turn to members of the party on my left. The other night they forced the House to sit for five and a half hours so we could vote on various provisions of a bill. They did it because they took the view that where time allocation is being used it is unfair and they had to show their objection.
I want to see them show their objections to this procedure tonight and insist on a vote on every clause. Let us see what they do. Or are they going to follow what Bobby Rae does and go soft on this bill? Bobby Rae told them to go soft on this bill in his speech yesterday. Are they going to do what Bobby Rae says, go soft on the bill and allow all the votes to be applied? Or are they going to sit here tonight and insist on the votes tonight? I will be here. I call on the hon. member to stay and to insist on it.

It is time to try to set the record straight.

Government Orders
Perhaps the most extreme and unsubstantiated claim being made is that Bill C-91 will significantly increase the cost of health care in Canada. Let us look at the facts. First, the entire wholesale drug market in Canada constitutes only 6 per cent of Canada's annual health care bill of about $60 billion, some $4 billion annually.
Patented drugs, which are the medicines affected by this legislation, make up only about 43 per cent of the annual total value of all drugs sold in Canada. That translates into a total annual cost of about $2 billion. That is the total cost for all the patented medicines.
Yet the member opposite has been running off at the mouth, saying there will be a $7 billion increase in prices while the total amount of patented medicines used in Canada only has a value of $2 billion.
Therefore, for opponents of this bill to charge that it will cost the Canadian health care system billions of dollars indicates to me they have a total lack of understanding of what this legislation is about.
As those who have read the legislation before this House will know, Bill C-91 will protect Canadian consumers from unwarranted increases in the cost of pharmaceutical products by expanding the powers of the board that reviews patented drug prices in Canada.
Some would say: ""On a perfect road you would not need a review board"". However, it is very necessary that we have a review board because it has proven itself since it was introduced in 1987.
First, let me explain exactly what the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board, the PMPRB, does. The board was created under the amendments to the Patent Act that came into force on December 7, 1987. Among other things, the amendments increased the patent protection available to the pharmaceutical firms. In exchange for the extended patent protection the Canadian pharmaceutical industry undertook to double its ratio of research and development to sales by the end of 1996.
I am reminded of the doom and gloom the members opposite talked about when we were doing the bill back in 1987.1 remember the demonstrations out on the lawn. I remember the job losses that were predicted by the opposition members. None of those things came about.
What did come about was the research that was promised by the companies and the extra jobs.
I will try to outline what has happened with the review board. The mandate of the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board is to ensure that the prices for patented medicines are not excessive. The board itself is an independent, quasi-judicial body. The Patent Act gives no power, formal or informal, to the government to direct the board or to review its decision and its orders.
However, decisions of the board are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court of Canada on jurisdictional or procedural grounds. This board's mandate has three specific components. First, the board's regulatory function is to ensure that the prices of patented medicines charged by patentees are not excessive. Second, the board is required to report annually on its activities, including a summary of pricing trends in the pharmaceutical industry. Third, the board must report annually on the ratios of research and development expenditures to sales for individual patentees and for the patented pharmaceutical industry as a whole.
The board has no regulatory authority over the prices of medicines that are not patented. Nor can it direct the levels of or nature of research and development expenditures of the pharmaceutical companies.
How does the board determine if the price is excessive? The Patent Act provides that the board take into consideration the following factors in determining whether the price of a patented medicine is excessive: the price of the medicine in the previous five years; the price of other medicines in the same therapeutic class; the price of those medicines in other countries; and the Consumer Price Index.
The board has developed its guidelines in recognition of the factors set out in the act put forward in 1987. These guidelines are not a rigid set of decision-making rules. They are intended to provide patentees with adequate information to establish in advance prices that may be presumed not to be excessive.
The record shows that the board has been successful in keeping increases in the prices of patented drugs well below the rate of inflation. Since this board was created the prices of existing patented drugs have risen by an average of only 2.9 per cent a year while the Consumer Price Index has risen by an average of about 4.4 per cent.
December 9, 1992

The PMPRB has been so successful it has earned the attention of our neighbours to the south. In the United States a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office recently compared the cost of prescription drugs in the United States and Canada. The study found that on average the manufacturers' price for prescription drugs was 32 per cent higher in the U.S. than in Canada.
Furthermore, the study found that half the drugs studied cost wholesalers at least 50 per cent more in the United States. Of the top selling 200 drugs, 27 cost at least 100 per cent more, three drugs cost 500 per cent more, and one, Isordril, which is used in the treatment of angina, cost an incredible 967 per cent more.
The Americans concluded that the Canadian system of controlling drug costs was working very well. The new legislation will make that system work even better.
Bill C-91 strengthens and extends the powers of the PMPRB. The board will continue to have the power to roll back prices to non-excessive levels and, because it will no longer be able to invoke compulsory licences as a remedy for excessive pricing, the bill provides the PMPRB with a range of new remedies.
The board will have the power to recoup excessive revenues earned by a company while the medicine was excessively priced. It will be able to order an extra price reduction for a sufficient period to claw back these excessive revenues, or alternatively it can impose a monetaiy penalty in the same amount.
In addition, if the board finds that the patentee has engaged in a policy of excessive pricing it will be able to impose double damages. That is, it can recoup twice the estimated excess revenues either through a price reduction order or a monetary penalty.
Much tougher sanctions will be also applied to patentees that fail to comply with a board order. This will be punishable as a criminal offence on a summaiy conviction and liable to fines of up to $100,000 per day for corporations and up to $25,000 per day for individuals.
Individuals will also be subject to imprisonment for up to one year. Alternately, the board will be able to file its orders with the Federal Court. Non-compliance with the Federal Court order would then be enforceable by the
Government Orders
usual sanctions for contempt of court, which are unlimited fines and periods of imprisonment.
Finally, the board will also be in a position to order double damages on the grounds that non-compliance amounts to a policy of excessive pricing. Tough penalties will also apply to companies that fail to submit required data. The PMPRB is a proven and effective mechanism for controlling patented drug prices.
Bill C-91 will make it even more effective in deterring unreasonable prices. Canada's track record on drug prices compares favourably with the situation in other countries. For example, the U.S. General Accounting Office showed that prices for most drugs in the U.S. doubled between 1985 and 1991, and some prices even quadrupled.
In Canada, as a result of the PMPRB, patented drug prices rose less than the rate of inflation. The Canadian system of drug price controls, centred on the PMPRB, has been extremely effective. In fact, pharmaceutical companies in Canada have a good record of compliance with the board's guidelines, and there has rarely been any need to respond-

I want to make one or two points on Bill C-91. This is one of the most unpopular pieces of legislation introduced by the most unpopular government in the history of our country, certainly since the beginning of polling in this country.
I find it very strange that we are in this House today, in 1992, debating whether we should keep compulsory licensing in the drug industry. We have a government that is very unpopular with a very unpopular piece of legislation saying that we should get rid of compulsory licensing. Yet at the same time a new President has been elected south of the border and a large fraction of the Democratic Party in Washington is now coming out in favour of compulsory licensing in its own country. Why? It is to bring down the cost of drugs to the American consumers.

Government Orders
Yet we have the Conservatives saying: ""No, it is not going to affect the prices. It is not going to increase prices any more than the cost of living, whatever that might be in 10 years' time"".
Somebody is wrong. Somebody is not telling the truth. We have American congressmen and senators visiting our capital from time to time extolling the virtues of our medicare system. Many in the U.S. Congress want to adopt a system similar to the medicare system in Canada which, on balance, has worked very well over the years since it was first implemented.
We now have a Conservative government which incidentally was opposed to medicare 25 years ago saying that the price of drugs will increase and that it is not going to do anything about it. This huge international drug cartel will be allowed to make even greater profits, driving up the price of drugs. That in turn will have a veiy serious impact on medicare.
The cost of drugs and the cost of medicare are really part of the same parcel. Many of our drugs in this country are provided to people, particularly to senior citizens and people on-

In our country, unlike most of the states in the United States, we do provide drugs free for our senior citizens and to those who cannot afford them, those on public assistance.
With the increase in the drug prices that this bill will create over the next several years, it means either the cost to the taxpayers, who provide the money for those drugs, will go up and our taxes will go up in order to keep that public drug program or we are going to have to become more exclusive and restrictive in our public drug programs with higher threshold entry levels.
We cannot have it both ways. That is an expression the people across from us in this very backward Conservative government like to use a lot in their arguments on a number of bills in this House.
It is very interesting that at this time we are listening to arguments by the government which say: ""Listen, there is a possibility that the drug companies, if this bill goes through might invest half a billion dollars in research in this country"". Yet at the same time, we have also been told by experts that the cost of drugs cumulatively could go up over the next 10 or 15 years, I believe, by $7 billion.
If that is a good business deal for the Conservatives, is it any wonder that our economy is in such a mess at this time? They cannot tell the difference between a good business deal and a lousy business deal.
Are we to allow Bill C-91 to go through and launch a massive assault directly and indirectly on our public medicare system in this country, or can we do anything at all in this Chamber to drive some common sense into the people opposite us in the Conservative government and say: ""We do not have to necessarily on this point move in lock step with the United States"".
I know this Conservative government would love to continue to Americanize our country. The Conservatives have done everything they can through the free trade agreement. They are going to continue it through NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement. For Heaven's sakes, when are we going to come to our senses and say that our country is different from the United States, or at least it used to be and what is left of that difference should be preserved.
Here again in this drug patent bill we see a caving in once again to powerful American drug companies in order to be in sync with the FTA, the free trade agreement, and with NAFTA. That is basically what it is all about. We are caving in once again to American corporate interests. We all know that the cost of drugs in the United States is astronomically higher than it is in Canada.

The government has brought in closure on the bill because I believe it does not want the bill to be debated on its substance.
This bill is protecting patents up to 20 years. It is going to cost the Canadian taxpayer a tremendous amount of money. That money is going to come from the Canadian taxpayer. The Canadian health care system is going to suffer because of that. It is estimated that it is going to cost the Canadian taxpayer over a billion dollars a year. There are different estimates. Maybe this one is a little bit high, but still it is an estimate that is certainly credible.
The Canadian Pharmaceutical Association believes that this bill is going to hurt those Canadian pharmaceutical companies that have their head offices in Canada, not those that are abroad. Most of the big pharmaceutical companies are located in Switzerland, Germany, France, England and the United States.
When I used to practise medicine, I could see that Canadians were beginning through the generic companies to manufacture drugs under licence. This was creating made in Canada companies. This government through its policies has been listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Minister for International Trade says that we need NAFTA. NAFTA is part of this deal and because of that, we will not have a manufacturing industry in Canada.
Since this bill was introduced, we have only had nine hours of debate. It is a major bill that is going to hurt manufacturing of drugs made in Canada. The government tells us this money that the big companies are going to make in Canada is going to be used for research and development. Naturally, some of this money might go to a couple of universities for research, but we are talking about huge amounts of money that the companies are going to transfer back to their head offices, whether it be in England, the United States, Switzerland, France or Germany. This is certainly not conducive to making Canada a country where industry can flourish.
What we need is not Bill C-91 or Bill C-22, but a reform of our taxation system where we would reward
Government Orders
wealth creation by Canadian companies. We should not create companies here that have head offices abroad.
Therefore I am voting against this bill and I hope that members who believe that Canada has to have its own trade policies will do the same.
