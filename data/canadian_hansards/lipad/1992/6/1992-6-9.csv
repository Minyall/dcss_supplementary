In other words, families on welfare would not receive an increase at all unless the inflation rate was over 3 per cent.
If that were the case and if the inflation rate were below 3 per cent we would see a decrease in benefits when it came to welfare families rather than an increase.
I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on this particular statement. In fact it is a valid analysis.

One thing I want to make perfectly clear with regard to families on welfare is that they will not have any of their benefits cut under this new program in Bill C-80.
As I mentioned in my closing remarks, it will be $2.1 billion of new funding that will go into this particular program. Actually, there will be 2.4 million families that are going to have their annual child benefits increased.
With regard to Mr. Ron Bell, I do believe he did come out initially with some negative comments, but it will be noticed that there has not been anything later with regard to comments. Once he has reviewed the program and taken a specific look at those families on welfare, he will be assured that there will be no cutback.
On CPI, the indexation for most government grants, contributions and the benefit packages are over the 3 per cent. This is not knew. Even the family allowance was cut back on the indexation back in the years of, I believe, 1974 to 1976. That is not to say that the government is not aware of the escalation of inflation, if there is one. It would be taking a yearly look at the benefits going to all Canadian families, not just specifically those on welfare.
In conclusion, I have to say that over the last couple of years, fighting inflation and getting it down to the lowest rate that it has been in 20 years-I believe last month it was 1.7 percent-is something that all people should be working toward. It means that a dollar today is worth a dollar tomorrow.

People have said that it makes little sense to them that the government provides social programs or provides cheques to families only to turn around and tax it back.
It seems in a common sense mode for a lot of people in my riding that the government should change this. Yet the Government of Canada has been on record as saying that social programs or universality has been a sacred trust.

I am wondering if the member can address that. Does she see this move in this new program to a more common sense attitude toward social programs, in other words a targeting of precious government resources to those who need them and perhaps an end to this concept that we must be all things to all people?

With regard to the precious revenues that we do have, there is only one taxpayer in Canada. Whether he or she is paying the municipal tax, the provincial tax or the federal tax, that taxpayer is the one who appears to get nailed.
What we are doing in this particular child benefit package is combining many family benefits into one monthly cheque that is non-taxable. It will be based solely on last year's tax return.
The hon. member is quite right that those in need, those who do need assistance from the government will receive it. It is actually over $76,000 a year on total income that it will be completely phased out. Those under $50,000 will lose nothing. Those over $50,000 will be slowly phased out, directly proportional to the income for that year.
I want to thank the hon. member for his assistance in working with the family caucus and the finance committee to see how we can become more streamlined in making sure that the funds we have go where they are needed.

There is no doubt about it that what we are trying to do here is to assist those people who are in the work force. Indeed, people on welfare are very needy people. Of course they will lose nothing under the child benefit package. Those people who have jobs will receive a tax incentive.
This should be combined with the program the Minister of Employment and Immigration put forward a few weeks ago. It is a pilot program dealing with single mothers in New Brunswick and British Columbia to top up their salaries. That is, for single parents on welfare who go out and find a job, we will top up their salaries so they can come closer to living within the community and be able to sustain not only their home and children, but also lift themselves out of the welfare system.
With these two programs in place, we will see a far greater incentive to get people off welfare. Obviously, it is a step in the right direction.

When it comes to the impact of Bill C-80 on the poorest family, there would be no increase. A family on welfare under the old system used to receive approximately $120 per month per child. Under the new benefit program, that family will receive the same thing.
When we are talking about those who are hit the hardest, there will be no extra money coming in from the proposed government bill. When we talk about those poor families, for example, when we look at single mothers on social assistance, they also will receive absolutely no additional funds as a result of the proposed legislation.

I had the pleasure of attending an annual meeting in the Ottawa area of the Our Kids organization. This organization has a mandate to build a better future for the children of the Ottawa-Carleton region.
It has a few purposes. One is to raise the priority for children in the eyes of the community. Another is to fund projects which meet children's basic needs of food, shelter, clothing, and education. As well, it encourages like-minded groups to work together on behalf of the children of the Ottawa-Carleton region.
I would like to commend this organization. It is two years old. It just elected a new board of directors. For the record, I would like to commend Janis Machin, who was elected as the president, Denise Mattok who was elected as the vice president, Diane Blenkiron as the secretary, Uttra Bhargava who was a member of the board and decided not to run again this year, Louise Allard, Stephan Klovan and Bernard Muzeen.
Last year these very capable people in consultation with the corporation and about 35 national and regional children's organizations managed to raise the profile of children in the Ottawa-Carleton region. Over 20,000 people visited the displays and facilities in an effort to create awareness in the community.
This is not the only thing that has taken place in my community. There is also St. Andrew's Church which in consultation with other community groups, business organizations, and church groups has embarked on an excellent partnership against poverty. As well, they are working collectively in order to promote awareness and do what they can as members of the community to deal with the subject of poverty in our society.
Recently, Our Kids sent a letter to the Prime Minister inviting him to attend one of its events some time in October 1992. In its letter it asked that Canada, or this House, designate a special day for children in Canada. We have Father's Day; we have Mother's Day; we have Canada Day. We have all sorts of days designated for special purposes. I want to echo those sentiments and add my voice to this organization in calling for the establishment of a national day to acknowledge our children, a child's day in Canada.
It would be appropriate to have that day on the anniversary of the meeting of the international community in New York on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
I would like to congratulate Our Kids and all the different organizations in my community that are working tirelessly in order to do what they can to help solve the question of poverty.
We hear a lot in the media about the city of Ottawa being a fat city. In fact, that is absolutely untrue. Simply put, just a few blocks away, child poverty is no different from any other part of Canada.
In fact, in excess of 24 per cent of the children living in this city are poor. In excess of 55 per cent of all families under the age of 25 with children are poor. One out of every three single mothers in this community is considered to be poor. In excess of 78 per cent of all poor in this region have children.
It will be seen that while many people call our city a fat city, there is another side which is the poor side.
Why do we talk about child poverty? Why are we interested in child poverty? It is part and parcel of a bigger problem and that is the health of the nation as a whole.
When a child is poor, more than likely the health of that child is affected. In fact the impact of poverty on child health is that there is two times the normal risk of dying before the age of 20. Simply put, based on mortality, a poor child has twice the normal infant mortality rate. These deaths are from injury, fires, drowning, pedestrian traffic accidents and so on, as well as an increased rate of chronic illness, particularly between the ages of four and 16 years.
There are other problems associated with child poverty, such as increased psychiatric disorders and physical and mental disabilities. These are all problems associated with and resulting from child poverty.
While we are dealing with poverty, the health of those children is also affected. Children have poor health simply because they have a poor start in life. For instance, women in low income groups have twice the risk of having a baby bom too soon or underweight. Therefore, the baby is doomed even before he or she is bom.
June 9, 1992

The cause of this is maternal stress, substance abuse, poor nutrition, and lack of social support. The result is children with physical and learning disabilities, as well as developmental delay.
As well, the child's housing situation may not be adequate or safe. Child care arrangements may not be as appropriate as they should be. In our national capital region there is approximately a two-year waiting list for subsidized day care. In Toronto, there are in excess of 7,500 people on the waiting list for child care. Obviously that is part and parcel of the over-all problem that must be addressed.
When discussing child poverty and what the government is trying to do to deal with it the first thing to do is take the legislation to those who are experts, those who deal with child poverty, to get their reaction to the government's proposal. The child benefit program proposed by the government has not been given much encouragement by the different groups involved with child poverty.
For example, Sue Wolstenholme of the Canadian Day Care Advocacy Association said: ""This and other examples from the budget indicate once again that either the federal government still does not grasp the problem of child poverty and child care which Canadian families face or they really do believe they can trick the public with yet another illusionary tactic"".
Mr. Gerard Kennedy from the Canadian Association of Food Banks had this to say about the bill: ""It is the most deceptive and cruel thing coming from government that we have seen in a long time, and a tremendous blow to the hope of low-income people"".
Patrick Johnston from the Canadian Council on Social Development had this to say on the bill:
There's no question that the potential benefits will be completely
offset by the lack of indexation. And it's done invisibly-that's the
worst part of it.
Ms. Lise Corbeil from the National Anti-Poverty Organization criticized the proposed child benefit because it is inadequate as an anti-poverty measure and it favours the working poor at the expense of the nonworking poor. She called the proposal a discriminatory package.
There are at least another seven or eight different organizations that deal with child poverty and every one
Government Orders
of them has opposed the proposal and said it is inadequate in dealing with child poverty.
The media has also not reacted very favourably to the government proposals. A report in The Globe and Mail on March 10, 1992 said: ""Report blasts child benefits. Says new system lowers incomes"". It goes on to say:
Single parents and other low income families will eventually lose
as much as 27 per cent of their income as a result of the new
program, the analysis shows.
The key element, which referred to the fact that there will be a loss in revenues, was indicated in the question that I proposed to the hon. member. Mr. Battle, who analyzed the proposals, indicated that if the inflation rate is at 3 per cent, for instance, there will be no revenues coming to welfare recipients and poor families.
In fact they will see a decline in their revenues. He indicated that if the inflation rate is 5 per cent the child benefit would only increase by 2 per cent. By the year 2000 many of the families who are now right at the poverty line will fall way below the poverty line.
Mr. Pierre Fortier, who is a senior official in National Health and Welfare, acknowledged that there will be slippage in the value of the child benefit. He said: ""There is a loss in each year where the inflation rate is greater than zero. I do not dispute that"".
I could not understand why the assistant to the minister would refute these comments in stating that the working poor in this country would see a decrease in their benefits from this bill rather than an increase. There is a correlation here. I am trying to build a case to demonstrate that we must do more if we are to deal with the poverty of our children.
This is true particularly in one area, which is education. Simply put, if we examine parents and their children who live in poverty it is more likely that the parents will not have a high educational level and that the children will have difficulty with school teachers and those who are assisting them in the community.
Let us examine the Ottawa-Carleton region and its people who are under the poverty line or may not be in a position to help themselves. Based on the 1986 census 25 per cent of poor families with children had less than grade 9 education.

Government Orders
That means that one out of every four people who are poor are poor because they have a lower level of education. Twenty-two percent of poor finished between grade nine to 13, 11 per cent have a diploma or certificate, and 9 per cent have a trade certificate or diploma.
Approximately 67 per cent of the people who live on or under the poverty line do not have a high school diploma or degree. There is a direct correlation between the level of poverty and the level of education.
These figures are for the national capital region and are no different from the statistics provided to us by metro Toronto, for instance. In metro Toronto 75 per cent of those who are going to food banks do not have a high school diploma.
The problem clearly is quite alarming. In order to deal with child poverty we have to attack it on not one but a number of fronts. I would like to move on to make some of the recommendations that my party has been putting forward.
First, we must deal with the heart of the problem. In many of our inner cities in Canada children are going to school hungry. Those children are not in a position to learn. Empty stomachs have no ears.
Therefore, our party has recommended that the federal government immediately participate with provincial and territorial governments, through their boards of education, in conjunction with community volunteers, in the provision of nutritionally balanced breakfast, lunch and snack programs in schools throughout Canada. That must become part and parcel of our educational system and it must take the form of a partnership with the community, both the business and the voluntary sectors.
We have also made a proposal that the federal government re-design the tax system to make it more equitable to help families cope with the added expense of raising children, and that it simplify the federal child benefit system as soon as possible. We are obviously not talking about the kind of simplification or complication that the government has done in Bill C-80.
We have called on the government to immediately announce its intention to create an accelerated job
creation program for students and youth so that it can be put in place for those who finish their school term and are looking for some sort of job for the summer period.
We have also called on the federal government to increase the federal minimum wage from $5 to $6 an hour by January 1, 1993.
These are some of the many recommendations that my caucus has put forward. I want to echo those sentiments in saying that we cannot really afford to ignore this problem because children are our future. Only through a proper strategy to deal with the educational system, to deal with a proper child care program, that goes right to the heart of the problem and that is a system of taxation, that addresses the question of housing for many families in inner cities across Canada and in some cases in rural Canada, can we say that we are dealing with the problem and that we are finding solutions to it.
It is really a shame that we live in one of the richest countries in the world and yet we still have child poverty at the rate that we are seeing. There is no reason that this government, along with provincial governments and municipal governments, cannot put together some sort of national conference at which all the different partners could sit together and try to set up a strategy to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000. After all, it was a decision of this House to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000.
On a final note, Mr. Speaker, despite the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which was ratified by this government, we have yet to see tangible proposals and strategies to attack child poverty right at its roots.

I want to put on the record of the House, before I ask him a question, the information that when this government took over, the child tax credit was $384 a year. In 1985-86 it was increased to $454 a year, to $489 a year in 1987, to $524 a year in 1988, to $559 a year in 1989, and it is presently $601 a year. The turning point, or the point, when the threshold would change, was changed back in 1985.
June 9, 1992

What has happened is that notwithstanding the provisions of the act, the government has successively changed the child tax credit proposals by changing the amount of benefit to more than compensate for inflation.
So much for all of the criticism this government has received from the hon. Ken Battle.
If he would pay attention to what has happened since 1985, he would find that the government has always honoured the requirement to look after children.
What has he got against an increase of $500 over the $1,020 presently available to those earning over $10,000 a year? Has he got something that he finds distasteful that a monthly payment should be made to parents? Does he think that is wrong or does he think that parents ought to get the benefit to support their children out of filing income tax deductions so that they will have to discount those tax deductions to a tax discounter? Does he think a tax discounter is the way people ought to get their money or does he think that a cheque coming monthly is more appropriate than the present system of redistribution?

While the Minister of Finance has claimed that the new system will increase the total federal child benefit by $400 million per year, a Senate committee report has indicated that since this government has taken office, there has been in excess of $3.5 billion taken out of the child benefit system between 1986 and 1991.
If the hon. member is telling me that with Bill C-80 a mother who is on welfare is getting more than she was getting before Bill C-80 was introduced, I think he is mistaken. Simply put, she is not receiving any extra benefits. A mother on welfare still receives the same type of benefits.
When we talk about the other increases of $500 or so for those who meet a certain threshold or are below a certain threshold, that is something different. That is when you divide it by the number of months or by the
Government Orders
number of days. I can assure hon. members there is nothing one can say. It is enough to solve the ongoing problem. What needs to be done is that the over-all system of taxation has to be reformed in order to help both those who do not have enough and those who do not have at all.
If the hon. member is telling me what is the best way of doing this, I would say that we have to go right to the heart of the problem, and that is our system of taxation.
Just recently, it was clearly indicated that in this country, the middle-income and the lower-income earners are perhaps paying more taxes than in any other industrialized country anywhere in the world. If we are to deal with the heart of the problem, that is an area that we can tackle.

3913417,ca.proc.d.1992-06-09.2.3.19,1992-06-09,10aaf198-11a8-4b29-ad9b-0af748c50627,ca.m.3981,Ms. Barbara Greene (Don Valley North):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,MEASURE TO AMEND,,"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-80 will implement the new child benefit announced by the government in the throne speech. It is part of a program of improved benefits for children and one of the results of a considerable amount of work by the Senate, the House of Commons subcommittee on poverty which I chair, our caucus committee on family issues, the Department of National Health and Welfare and the Department of Finance.
It is not a new idea to roll all child benefits into one benefit in order to rationalize and simplify child benefits. But the method by which this one has been accomplished is quite creative and will make the system more fair, particularly in the long run.
The subcommittee on poverty recommended the rollup of child benefits with the transfer from other personal tax credits. The subcommittee also recommended a guaranteed earned income supplement which would ensure that income received from employment would be greater than that received by social assistance recipients.
The department has been able to introduce a benefit which establishes structure which will achieve this objective for some families now, but also sets a framework to achieve this objective for more families in the future.
The majority of our subcommittee agreed that it was important to have a social assistance framework that helps people to work. That is the best way to escape poverty and that is the way most social assistance recipients also think. I think it is fundamental, and I am certain most Canadians agree to that.

Government Orders
I once participated in a survey of social assistance recipients with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and found that almost 100 per cent of social assistance recipients have the same values that all Canadians have. They too want to work and really appreciate help in achieving that objective.
I am very disappointed that there is not some more money in this program for welfare recipients who are unable to work. However, there are benefits for welfare recipients. They will receive their benefit monthly and will not be resorting to tax discounters.
It should also be noted that the child benefit is discretionary income and should not be used as a substitute for an adequate social assistance income.
Our committee also recommended that there be standards for basic social assistance and supplementary benefits that would ensure that the basic needs of children and adults are met. Only Ontario and Prince Edward Island currently have systems that provide such standards. However, under the current structure of social assistance in Canada, this is provincially initiated.
I understand that the minister is having discussions with his provincial counterparts. It seems to me that issue has to be pursued. I think that if in fact we cannot get provincial agreement that we should seriously look at some kind of guaranteed annual income across the country similar to the system in place for senior citizens that would ensure that there is a national standard for social assistance. I think it is a shame to this country that in fact we do not have that now and that in some provinces the gap between basic needs level assistance and what they are getting is enormous. It is quite unacceptable.
This particular benefit should cover discretionary needs. The earned income supplement should recognize the additional costs of working and compensate for the fact that earned income does not consider the number of children in the family, unlike welfare income. There needs to be that kind of support in order to, at least in the long term, ensure that the people are better off financially working.
I am, therefore, pleased to support this bill as major progress on two of the recommendations of the subcommittee on poverty. I have already mentioned the social
assistance standards. I think that is the key in order that children in Canada have an adequate opportunity to develop and participate in the many benefits of this society. Improved minimum wages, education, retraining programs, job opportunities and programs specifically targeted at high-risk children as well as more subsidized day care are other things that must be pursued in order to improve the situation of poorer children.
The opposition has raised a number of arguments against this particular benefit, some of which other members have already answered. I would just like to make a comment on the arguments about universality. I would rather have universal opportunity for children in Canada. My riding, which is a fairly high income one and will have a substantial number of families that will lose benefits, I believe supports this benefit. I have circulated a lot of information on it. We have had a lot inquiries and I have only had positive response.
I think the vast majority of Canadians who are well off want to see a dramatic improvement in the lot of the poorest children.
In addition, the opposition has slammed many of the recommendations of the subcommittee on poverty. I noticed the NDP opposition critic on television Sunday night after Venture again slamming us on these particular issues. I find that rather extraordinary because the response to the subcommittee's report from the social community, the social issues community, the many agencies that have appeared, has been overwhelmingly positive. I have had letters from various agencies that appeared before the committee. They support the recommendations.
I often think surely if these agencies supported these recommendations, and if in fact the opposition really cared about children, they could have been far more supportive on that particular report. What in fact has the opposition offered? First of all, it wants all transfer payments to the provinces restored as if it were feasible to continue on the spiralling expenditure increases that have been occurring, principally in Ontario. That is nonsense. We have to live within our budget and spend our money better on those who need our help and in such a way that we do not encourage long-term dependency.
June 9, 1992

Recommendations of the opposition include a national school lunch program in schools throughout Canada, a huge expensive program that gives to everyone whether they need it or not. I will tell you in my community we do not want it. It has been discussed thoroughly at metro council and so on. Local communities do have programs and I think that is fine. I think where the community wants to put in a program in a particular school, that is great, but a massive nationally run program I do not agree with at all.
I know for example in the schools in North York we have a great number of people from different ethnic communities who do not eat the same and do not want their children to be provided with food at the school. However, we strongly encourage things like nutrition programs where the children learn about proper nutrition. That is basically what the poverty report encouraged.
I think helping people who need help rather than helping everyone is the much more effective and much more sensible way to proceed, rather than creating dependency.
On the issue of the food banks, if you speak privately to some of the NDP members of the provincial government in Ontario, they are not too crazy about food banks at all. They create further dependency and that does not help people in the long run. The whole prospect of people lining up for food is in fact something that is very shameful in our society. Eliminating food banks is the way to proceed.
Winter works programs, public sector youth employment programs, universal broadly targeted programs that dramatically increase taxes result in little improvement for the neediest members of our society. Having been in municipal politics previously, I am very much aware of these winter works programs and who goes out to get those particular jobs. They tend to be men. If we look at poverty, it is predominantly women who are affected. They are also short-term jobs. They tend to increase municipal costs because of the supervision and they are
Government Orders
not long term. They stop people from working because in fact they are not available to go out and get real jobs.
Then there are the pie in the sky policies, like the critic for the NDP who spouts his full employment policy and who cannot tell us how he would accomplish this. Every government has a full employment policy. Unfortunately, the NDP one in Ontario is not working any better than ours at the moment.
One thing is for certain, our government will not follow the model of the Liberal Party, which in 1981 to 1982 tried to spend us out of a recession, which resulted in the enormous deficit and debt treadmill that we are currently battling with some success. There are no magic answers and very few people are fooled by such propaganda.
Long-term, sensible economic policies, controlling debt, spending within our means and targeting our social spending to really help those in need is the way to proceed.
This child benefit and the child development initiative which will allow many of the community-based prevention programs targeted at high-risk children between the ages of zero and seven will make major progress on this most important issue of child poverty.
As a member of Parliament, I will continue to pursue other measures such as improved access to day care, particularly for high-risk children, standards for social assistance, improvements in the minimum wage and indeed, improvements in this program over the long run. We have to recognize there are no magic solutions to these problems. There is a need for hard work to endeavour to try and solve, to work at some of these areas, to make progress.
I have been associated with these issues in Toronto since 1972. I do see a lot of progress in Toronto and I hope to see a lot more progress at the national level.

Government Orders
I have in my riding 25 per cent who are single parents and most of those people are women. A lot of them are working and a lot of them are not. Last week I had a number of them say to me that $500 or $10 a week is not really that great an incentive to move them off the welfare rolls and into the work force.
The problem is there is no incentive to stay in the work force because $10 a week does not really cover their drug problem if they have a child or two. In other words, when you are on welfare all of those costs are covered.
My question to the member is whether she really believes that $500 is a sufficient enough credit. Does she not think maybe we should do something that is a little bit more dramatic in terms of providing incentive to move people from the welfare rolls into the work force where they can not only regain their dignity and become retrained? Under the current system they are almost entrapped in poverty and I am not sure this is enough.

This is a start. It is $500 worth of help for the working poor. It is not intended to cancel out any of the existing programs, such as the Step program in Ontario that does provide supplementary benefits until the income of the family is above a certain level associated with the poverty line. Those programs will still be in place but this provides additional help. The combination of this program plus the Step program is very positive. We have improved things a bit.
In the long run I would like to see a more careful analysis of this because I think it will lower the number of people in poverty. If you look at the statistics, they are income related and it will take a few more people off the poverty rolls who are working.

It is basically the amount of money required depending upon the area, whether it is a large city or a small city, to cover basic needs, plus about an additional 40 per cent to cover discretionary needs.
This $500 per family will remove some people. I am not sure how many. You would have to get Statistics Canada to actually work it out, but it will drop a number. They will be people who are working that are poor and
under that line. It seems to me that it is an achievable objective to at least get people who are working full time in this country above the poverty line. The amount of dollars necessary varies by province. It varies by the minimum wage in a particular province. In Ontario they are at the poverty line for an individual right now. They are not at the poverty line for an individual with children. The single parent, of course, is confronting the issue that there is only one income. If you had two incomes you would probably, at the minimum wage, be at the poverty line for a family with one child.

I gather that she is not that close to some of the school lunch programs because she certainly characterized them very differently from my experience.
In Vancouver East, a multicultural community with a very, very high percentage of poor children, our schools in co-operation with the community have developed excellent school lunch programs. We work very hard to try and get federal interest in them which, unfortunately, has not happened. We do now have some provincial subsidies.
The results of this are quite astounding. I would ask her when she is in Vancouver to come and visit these programs. In a relatively inexpensive program there have been remarkable changes in the way that children can remain in school. Their interest span has increased and their achievement in school programs has also improved. Many of them, of course, were kids who came to school with no breakfast and perhaps went home at night to maybe just a bit of junk food if they were lucky, and were simply not getting the kind of nutrition they needed. By supplying a simple and not terribly expensive but very nutritious hot meal at noon, these children have shown remarkable improvement in health and in their school participation.
The point I want to raise is that the member gave the impression that these were very expensive programs. The families who can pay the full amount. Those who cannot, pay when they can or do not pay at all. It is all done in a way so there is no stigma attached because nobody knows what any other child is paying. It is an excellent program.
June 9, 1992

When you add to that the kind of ethnic outreach that is done from the school, the kind of public health programs that are added to it and the head start programs that should be there at the pre-school level, it is a tremendous investment in anti-poverty measures as well as measures that are healthy for all children. It does not cost very much per child.
I would like to commend all the teachers and people who work on these programs, the many volunteers and many parents in Vancouver East.
My question, however, is related to child care. I know the member has done a lot of research on the needs of children and she cares about this very much. But I wonder if she shares my concern, having been on the child care task force which documented over and over again in communities across Canada and with extensive research the need for child care across this country, the urgent need. This was a number of years ago and it has increased since that time, I am sure she would agree. The Prime Minister twice promised Canadians there would be a national child care program in 1984 and 1989. Now the Minister of National Health and Welfare and the Minister of Finance say we will not have this program. Therefore, it is a complete denial, both of need and of the Prime Minister's promises.

There are many, many families that want to send their children to schools with lunches they have prepared.
On the question of day care, I am very disappointed in the decision of government, which quite surprised me. I think the program as recommended in this report, which was endorsed by the national day care lobby group, is one that is affordable. In the long run, it will develop the kind of system that we need.

I still intend to pursue the matter, particularly the refundable child care tax credit because that is a benefit which could go directly to families to enable them to access some of the licensed day care. Only 8 per cent of children in Canada have access to licensed day care.

According to the government, its motives are entirely honourable. And on the face of it, the proposed legislation seems quite acceptable. We are talking about simplifying income tax returns, maintaining more generous benefits for children under 7 and for large families, increasing the incomes of families with an income of less than $50,000 and increasing federal benefits by $2.1 billion over the next five years.

It does seem that the government is trying to do something decent, but when one looks closer, something is wrong. Under this great plan of the government lies quite another reality. Nearly one million Canadian families work very hard to make ends meet on incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 each year. If the amount seems reasonable, let us keep in mind that this revenue is much smaller, net, thus giving minimum leeway to face the everyday needs and demands of a growing family.
The government will offer these families a fantastic amount of $4 a month more under the proposed child tax benefit. Is that not great?

The Conservative government, the same government that keeps repeating that children are the future of this country, forgot to tell us that between 1986 and 1991, it withdrew more than $3.5 billion from child benefit programs. And today? It is still taking money out of the pockets of Canadians who have trouble making ends meet.
This is a government that ignores 2.5 million Canadians who are on welfare. This is a government that watches as plants close, stores go bankrupt and people are laid off. Then, like in the Christie commercial, says: ""Whoops"", hoping a miracle will happen to save the day.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
Let us face the facts. The government must take the bull by the horns and do something to save the human potential our children represent before it is too late.

Where is the so desperately needed national day care program? Once again, this government has found an answer: Place it on the back burner. The reason given this time: The government wants to help abused and hungry children.
I must admit I do not understand its way of functioning. For the past seven years, this government has cut back on every support for these same abandoned children, and it wants us to believe today that it is working toward making their future more secure and bright. What a joke.

The fact that in 1992 we are still talking about national day care proves the Conservative government cannot be trusted. It proves the government cares very little about the real needs of Canadians. And it proves above all the government certainly does not want to get involved in a program that will not reap political benefits in the short term. This government is afraid of investing in the long term. It does not understand that child tax benefits do not deal with the problem of poverty, drop-outs and illiteracy. How can we expect children to pay attention in class if they come to school with empty stomachs? How can we expect children to go to school without shoes? How can we expect young people to have a trade if we do not remove these barriers?
I would like to quote the Minister of State for Employment and Immigration who said on March 10 of this year: ""Must I repeat for this House that we believe our children represent the future of our country and that through this budget we are helping families who need social and economic assistance, particularly one-parent families who need additional help. Too often we forget to mention that this budget contains benefits for families and children and that day care services will be maintained through other programs and other measures"".
Is that not interesting? What the Minister of State for Employment and Immigration forgot to say was that the net child benefits for a family with an average income are
worth barely half of what they were worth seven years ago.

If the government thinks it can fool Canadians with a bill like C-80, it is mistaken. It may make a few people happy and give the impression it is being fair by taking money from higher income groups and giving some crumbs to the less fortunate in this country, but this is just a drop in the bucket.
The need for national day care, a program promised so long ago we have almost given up hope, is becoming increasingly critical. We must face the fact that for so many of our young people the future looks very grim indeed.
Not long ago, for many people it marked the beginning of their education. Our society felt it was essential to develop a healthy mind in a healthy body. Today, for many children a healthy body is something they cannot afford.
National day care is not a frill but a necessity. The money this government makes available to families in need is no guarantee that children will find space in a day care centre. In some cities there is a three-year waiting list.
Children need to be loved, nurtured and fed properly and to grow up in a healthy environment. Parents-often there is only one-know that today, those who have trouble making both ends meet need help. Promises for a better tomorrow are useless because it will be too late.

This government, by offering so little, is trying to clear its conscience. This way it can try to sell the notion that it has done all it could to help families in need by giving a few bucks more.
What people need is dignity. That comes through work not hand-outs. What children need is an introduction to society through security. That comes from day care centres, not because the home cannot provide it, but because the fact is that in 1992 most parents must work to make ends meet. What teenagers need is a future. That comes through an education adapted to the 21st century and an economy on the rise.
Those are the priorities this country should have. Those are the priorities that must be addressed soon. Time is against us, and if we do not act now, tomorrow will be very grim.
June 9, 1992



Although it may look good to give families a few dollars more, let us not forget what this government spends on public relations and advertising. I realize the two are necessary, but perhaps some spending restraint would be in order.
A truly responsible government that tries to deal with the fundamental problems and save our young people would be willing to tighten its belt, review its priorities and act accordingly.
I think it is high time for us to take a close look at the system of pension benefits available to members of Parliament and paid for by Canadians, because there is a double standard here. I agree everyone is entitled to a pension, but always payable upon reaching retirement age. This is really the icing on the cake. Other Canadians have to work long and hard to earn a minimum of pension benefits, and they have to wait until they reach a certain age to receive those benefits.
This is just one example of the government's lack of conviction in looking for other ways to get this country out of its financial mess, to create national day care centres, stress retraining and get the economy back on track. A responsible government is not afraid to cut certain non-essential benefits enjoyed by a chosen few.

I am convinced this country can be pulled together again and that we can get the economy up, but it is essential that our 292 food banks disappear. The government must start making that a priority today. It is unacceptable that in 1992 in Canada so many people must rely on food banks to survive.
This government keeps telling Canadians that it has great training programs. It keeps announcing how many jobs have been created. It keeps forgetting to say how many jobs have disappeared for good.

If the present government is at all serious about economic recovery, it should act. It should start at the
Government Orders
bottom with day care, to ensure that all children have a fair chance. It should invest in education so that all Canadians have the tools they need to make a living and can do without the financial crutches offered by the government. It should establish a short-term and effective action plan to wipe out poverty.
Is this not the same government which announced that by the year 2000, in less than 8 years, child poverty would be a thing of the past? Today, at this very moment, nearly one million children go to food banks. Is that normal? If the children have reached that stage, it means the parents have as well. What is being done in concrete terms to deal with the problem? How can these people believe things will get better? Is Bill C-80, which will give them a few dollars more, going to make a difference? I doubt it.
A country is not built on poverty and desperation but on faith in the future and hard work. Canadians are not afraid of hard work, but first they must find work. This country was built, and it is still growing, thanks to the labour and sacrifices of people who thought it was worth while to invest in Canada. Today, now that times are particularly hard for people at the bottom of the ladder, it is up to the government to do its share. It has received a lot from its citizens. Now it is up to the government to cut its profits and tighten its belt. It must act now to put back some of what it has received.

There are at least 2.5 million Canadians who depend on social welfare. This is not a choice but a necessity. The number of homeless who do not collect any other revenue than what they get from begging is growing day by day. Violence is on the rise. Drugs are the escape. Suicides occur daily among people of all ages. The picture is grim.
The government does not want to see it. The government does not want to address it. The media barely mentions it but it is a fact. Canada does have problems. Canada has a major problem if it has so many of its citizens in need.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
A bandage answer like Bill C-80 will not help solve anything. It might add a few dollars, but with inflation and taxes you cannot go very far on that.
In a country as rich as ours how can we accept the fact that so many children live in poverty? Where are the grassroot programs to give people the tools to make it? Of course there are some training programs, but how do you get there when you cannot find a babysitter or, even worse, you cannot afford one?
This government has to get its priorities in the right order or this country will simply not make it. People need a sense of value. They need to know that they are doing something worth while. They need to earn a living. No one wants a handout. It is when no one believes in you that you fall apart and cannot contribute to society. Too many have already fallen into this trap.
This government must get the country working again. It must make the citizens of Canada proud of themselves again.

The Conservative government must understand what is happening in this country. There are some very real problems and the government must act now. If it has not yet understood what Canada's priorities are, the people of this country will be glad to remind the government of those priorities in the next election.

I want to continue to pursue this feature of the legislation that the government seems to be so proud of, this $500 credit that it talks about for people at the lower end of the spectrum. In the papers the government released, it is suggesting that this $500 will be an incentive for those people in the work force to stay in the work force. I am talking about people making $14,000 to $16,000 a year. The government thinks that this $500 credit is sufficient to maintain their interest.
There are many single parents in my community who are out of work right now because of the economy. If they were on welfare they might receive around $10,000 to $12,000. If they went into the work force and made $16,000 or $17,000 by the time the taxes were taken off they would probably receive the same amount as they would on welfare.
Yet the government thinks that this $500 tax credit is really sufficient to keep them motivated to stay in the work force. Five hundred dollars in a nice glossy brochure looks like something. We do not emphasize the fact that it is not going to kick in until 1993. We are talking about legislation today but it is not going to kick in until 1993.
That is $10 per week or to be more specific, about $1.50 per day. What happens if all of a sudden there is a medical bill and a person needs prescription drugs? I just cannot understand why the government thinks that this $500 credit is a meaningful sum of money to those who are at the lower end of the income spectrum.

fellows were making. I thought that they might have salaries of $80,000 per year. They were saying that they had income tax problems as well, while discussing the pros and cons of this bill with us. I wonder how many of them had got to the point at which $1.50 a day became important in their lives. It was as though by giving this $500 they were doing a wonderful thing for the single parents of Canada.
I agree with the member. When a child is sick one week's medicine is not covered by the $10 parents are getting for a week. Actually it is not $10 per week but about $9.50.
There is no incentive for them to get back in the work force. The $500 is not going to mean a thing. Most of them are better off on welfare. Five hundred dollars is not enough to pull them off the welfare rolls or to keep them off the welfare rolls. It is all very well to say that a lot of women are making $14,000 to $16,000 a year but the jobs they are in are jobs that will very soon be affected by a new free trade deal. It is going to hurt them even worse and then the government will just sit back and say: ""Well, we gave you $500"". I hope that answers your question.

Bud Bird (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,MEASURE TO AMEND,,"Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to speak in support of this landmark legislation to strengthen Canada's income assistance measures for children and families. Bill C-80 recognizes our commitment to financially assist with children's needs through a child benefits system that is fundamentally fair, simple and generous.
It contains the most sweeping improvements in federal benefits for children since the child tax credit was created in the 1970s, and arguably is the most important change since the first family allowance was paid in 1945.
Bill C-80 has three major elements. It amends the Income Tkx Act to create the new child tax benefit, it introduces the Children's Special Allowances Act and it repeals the Family Allowances Act.
This initiative is part of the federal government's over-all strategy called ""Brighter Futures"", a preventive and multi-faceted program directed primarily at intervention in the early stages of the lives of children who
Government Orders
are faced with greater than normal risks of poor health and nutrition, mental problems, mental health problems, disability or injury, abuse and neglect.
""Brighter Futures"" is composed of four main program areas: prevention, promotion, protection and partnerships. Through this strategy the federal government will spend another $500 million over five years in the fight to protect Canada's children from poverty, neglect, abuse, ill health and unsafe living conditions.
The bill before us today is a very important component of this call to action on behalf of Canada's children.
To discuss and examine the new child tax benefit it is necessary to understand our present child benefits system. Currently, the federal government spends $4.5 billion each year on three major programs for children: family allowances; the refundable child tax credit; and the non-refundable dependent child credit.
Family allowances are delivered in monthly payments of $35 per child to all eligible Canadian families. They are taxable and must be declared by the spouse with the higher income. Payments are then partly or completely recovered if one parent has a net 1992 income above $53,215.
Under the family allowance program a special allowance is also payable on behalf of a child under 18 years who is institutionalized or in foster care.
The second component of our present child benefits system is the refundable child tax credit. This consists of an income tested benefit claimed through the tax system. The maximum payment of $601 per child is reduced for families with incomes above $26,000. Two-thirds of the credit may now be prepaid in November, depending upon the family income.
The third component of our present child benefits system is the non-refundable dependent child credit, also administered by Revenue Canada. This non-refundable credit is a reduction of taxes for the parent who is the higher income spouse. Its annual 1992 value is $71 for each of the first two children and $142 for each additional child. The dependent child credit applies only to families with sufficient income to pay income taxes.

Government Orders
One may ask as to what is wrong with the current child benefit system. Let me explain what I consider to be the key problems. The most important is that the system provides inadequate support for low income working families. These are the families who are most often faced with employment related expenses and the possible loss of provincial social assistance benefits by choosing to work.
The present child benefits system does nothing to reinforce their incentive to work. Families with children receiving social assistance and services may actually be getting thousands of dollars more than families with children who are surviving and yet working at low wage jobs.
It is true that the current system directs more benefits to low income families than to high income families but it still does not do enough to target child benefits where they are really needed the most.
There are two problems here. The first is that wealthy families continue to receive child benefits even though they have relatively little need for such benefits. If we are to provide increased assistance for children in low and modest income families then we can no longer afford to pay benefits for those in high income brackets.
The second problem is that family allowances are directed on the basis of individual income instead of family income. This is true both in their taxability as income and in the repayment required for higher income individuals. This means families with similar total incomes may receive different levels of child benefits. As a result, children with similar needs may be treated differently. Family income is a much more equitable basis for directing assistance to children, and the new program is aimed exactly in that direction.
The delay in delivery of the benefit under the current system is another key problem. For many families the refundable child tax credit represents more than half of their federal child benefit, but being an annual payment it often fails to meet their immediate needs when those cash requirements occur.
The full amount of the credit is paid only after tax returns are assessed. This delay in payment is difficult for families with modest incomes. They must pay for
their children's needs every month but they frequently have to wait more than one year to receive the full credit.
This was partially addressed in 1986 by introducing a prepayment of a portion of the credit in November each year. This advance payment provision was brought about to assist families in need, especially those who required the money so much that sometimes they even sacrificed their pending credits to tax discounters.
Even with this small improvement the system is still too slow to address the changing dynamics of family structure. For example, a child bom in January or February does not receive a child tax credit until more than one year later.
The current system is a patchwork system. Benefits are delivered in various ways. There are different eligibility requirements for each program.
For example, family allowances are based on individual income while the refundable child tax credit is based on family income. It is confusing to have a different income system for each benefit. As well, having to fill out all of the calculations on the child tax credit form, which is effectively a new application each year, adds complexity to the system.
Furthermore, the government continues to pay family allowances to all high income families although they are subject to repayment of those benefits through the tax system. Many are asking what the purpose of paying these benefits is if they are only taxed back.
This policy was designed to ensure that the benefits of the family allowances program would be better targeted to lower income groups and it did achieve that end. However, of course we continued to consider whether a better way could be found, one that would not require any repayment and one that would avoid the additional administrative costs generated by first making payments and by then recovering them.
I point out these weaknesses not to undermine the value of the programs that have existed up to now. They have done a valuable job in helping Canada's children over many decades, at a cost of billions of dollars that were largely spent. Now we must recognize the need for fundamental improvements to that system.
June 9, 1992

There is no question that the new child tax benefit put forth in this bill before us today is a significant advance over our current system. In light of today's complex society this bill proposes an enriched benefit which is streamlined, responsive and better targeted. It is one that incorporates suggestions from two recent parliamentary committees, one here and one in the other place, from many non-governmental social policy groups and many individual Canadians.
For the benefit of my colleagues I would like to repeat the key features of this child tax benefit. The proposed benefit will be a single monthly payment for children under 18. It will generally be made to the mother. This new benefit will be based on family income rather than on individual income. These single monthly payments will neither be taxed nor recovered at tax time so that what families receive they will get to keep in full.
There are two major components of the proposed child tax benefit. The first is a basic monthly benefit that replaces the present family allowance. It also replaces the dependant child tax credit and refundable child tax credit, and includes extra benefits for children under the age of seven and children in larger families.
The second is a new federal earned income supplement that will increase the basic benefit by up to $500 per year for low income working families with children. The actual benefit payable will depend on family earnings and income, as well as the number and ages of children in the family. Entitlement will be calculated automatically based on the previous year's income tax returns, eliminating the need to fill in a special form every year as is now required by the child tax credit.
It will be composed of a base amount of up to $1,020 per year for each child, with a $75 supplement for the third and subsequent children. The base amount is increased by a further $213 per year for each child under seven if child care expenses are not claimed at tax time. The basic child tax benefit amount will be paid in full to all families with incomes up to $25,921. The benefit will gradually reduce for those with incomes above that amount.
In addition, there will be an earned income supplement of up to $500 a year for working families. The earned income supplement will be phased in for families
Government Orders
earning above $3,750. This supplement will reach its full amount of $500 when family earnings are $10,000 or more and will only begin to reduce over an upper threshold of $20,921. For families making a total of $25,921, the upper threshold, or more the earned income supplement will be eliminated.
What does this mean to a Canadian family? A single mother with two children over the age of seven with a family income of $30,000 would receive $153.25 a month beginning in 1993. She would be better off, compared to present circumstances, by approximately $300 per year.
Another mother with three children over the age of seven with a total family income of $22,000 in 1991 will be eligible for a basic amount of $261.25 plus an earned income supplement of $32.68 per month. This means that she will receive beginning in January 1993, a total of $293.93 in benefits each month. She will be better off, compared to her current circumstances, by about $400 per year.
This new system is intrinsically more fair. It is based on family income and not individual income. It is targeted at those who most need it so that assistance is focused on low and middle income families. The child tax benefit will be gradually reduced for families with incomes above the designated thresholds. The entire benefit will be paid monthly, making it vastly easier for families to budget properly. It will also be much less likely that when there is a change in custody the benefit will be paid to the wrong parent.
It is not only the fundamental design of the new system that demonstrates the government's commitment to the social well-being of families with children. This new system will be more generous than the current one. Over the next five years the government has committed an additional $2.1 billion to assist families with children through this program. Over 2.4 million families will have increased child benefits. Over two-thirds of them will be families with incomes of less than $50,000. No family with an income below $50,000 will lose any benefits.
The new income supplement will provide special protection for some of the most vulnerable members of our society, families with low earnings. The new earned income supplement will help these families stay in the

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
work force and meet the needs of their children. This new supplement will also help families on social assistance to deal with the loss of those social assistance benefits as they move into the work force. It is one step toward, maybe not as generous as we would all like to see, dismantling the welfare trap.
Single parents have the greatest need for child assistance because they bear the combined responsibility of earning a living and caring for their children. In addition to the new child tax benefit single parents will retain the present equivalent to married credit for their first child. For many this is worth an average of $1,445 in reduced federal and provincial taxes each year.
Overall, this new child tax benefit will be much simpler and more efficient to administer. It consolidates three current programs into one. The child tax benefit will be jointly administered by the Departments of National Health and Welfare and Revenue Canada taxation. National Health and Welfare will be responsible for receiving initial applications and providing general information about the program. Revenue Canada will determine entitlement based on family income to calculate the amount of the tax credit each month and will authorize the payments.
I would like to turn for a few minutes to another aspect of Bill C-80, the introduction of the Children's Special Allowances Act. Currently, the Family Allowances Act has a provision to assist with the care of children in foster homes and other institutions. It is most important to this government that we continue to provide for these children, many of whom are being cared for in this way, because they are children at risk. Any department, agency or institution that is entitled to apply for a special allowance under the existing Family Allowances Act will continue to receive that benefit under the new Children's Special Allowances Act.
However, we have gone further. From a point of view of equity the government feels that it is important that payments on behalf of these children in care are equivalent to those for all other children. Therefore, the monthly special allowance payment will increase from the current $52.03 to $85.00 per month. It is not a great increase in dollars but nonetheless it is an increase of 60 per cent in the support we are providing for these 30,000 children.
The bill before us today underscores this government's commitment to social and fiscal responsibility. The child tax benefit is the end result of an extensive review which stressed the need for considerable change. Consolidation of three programs into one represents a sound and socially responsible solution. The improvements will be greatly appreciated by most Canadians.
With this new child tax benefit families with low and middle incomes will gain. The earned income supplement will provide extra support for those with low wages and will reinforce incentives to participate in the work force. Virtually all single parent families will enjoy increased benefits.
The dedicated staff of both of these government departments charged with the implementation of the new program are already deeply involved in their work, switching some 3.7 million files into the new program structure. Of course their work can only progress to a certain point, pending the decisions of this Parliament.
I am sure that hon. members in their deliberations on this bill will bear in mind how important it is for Canadians to receive their first monthly payments on time in January 1993, especially since most of these monthly payments will be significantly larger than they would be under the current legislation.
In closing, I am pleased with the new directions we are taking to assist families with children in low income circumstances. In total there are approximately 6.6 million children in Canada and it is a staggering fact that over one million of them, 17.5 per cent, are presently at some form of risk because of poverty, ill health, poor living conditions, abuse or neglect.
With this bill we are taking an important step forward in maintaining and improving the well-being of many of those children. The child tax benefit is one measure among a wide range of initiatives being developed for the children of Canada.
The future of this world belongs to our children. Let us work together in this House to ensure that the future for Canadian children remains the brightest in all the world.

Perhaps the hon. member who has just spoken can assist me.
June 9, 1992

His government has been in office for some eight years. I am wondering if he can explain whether it is pure coincidence that this initiative is taking place now on the eve of a general election campaign. Can he indicate why it took this government eight years to realize that Canadian families and Canadian children were in desperate need of assistance from the national government?
Can he explain the coincidental timing of this particular initiative? Would he not agree that Canadians could be justified in concluding that this government is more motivated by its desperate desire to be re-elected than by a sincere concern for the children of Canada?

It left deficits ranging close to $40 billion a year and a recession brought about by those circumstances. That made it absolutely impossible to find any flexibility for the kinds of initiatives that are being introduced at this time.
It has only been through the fiscal management of this government, through the reduction of government program spending from 13.5 per cent for 15 years of Liberal rule to 3.9 per cent over the last eight years, through the realization of a program surplus in our operating account that we are able to contemplate the kind of expenditures over the next five years that are set out in this bill.
If the hon. member had stopped to think about the real cause that has inhibited our government and our country in serving its citizens as they deserve he would be embarrassed to have asked that question.

He particularly mentioned the high priority needs of single parents raising children on their own, most of them single mothers.
When he talked about those needs did he not mention the need for child care? Does he not realize that this is a burning need for most parents, that when both parents are forced to be in the work force they need reliable licensed child care? Even greater is the need of single mothers for child care.
Government Orders
The child benefits program that he is talking about gives a special incentive, a special bonus, which is really a two-tiered philosophy that is rather regressive. The good working poor will get an extra bonus if they go to work but those who are forced to stay on welfare will not.
In particular the single mother will have very little opportunity to get off welfare and seek employment, even in the minimum wage jobs that are probably the only ones available. A mother cannot go to work if she does not have reliable child care for her children. Why did he not take this into account and what does he feel about this?

This bill, in the structure of the child tax benefit, in the structure of the earned income supplement and in the structure of the tax credits available to single parents, does attempt to take cognizance of the fact that the single parent is charged with the responsibility of both caring for the child and of earning the family income.
It is always desirable that we should want to do more. However, in addressing the issue of the child through this child tax benefit and in increasing the benefits to low and middle income families, and particularly to single parent families, we are inherently addressing the subject of child care. We have maybe not done so to the extent that we all would wish but within the circumstances and resources available to us. I think it points in the direction that will serve Canadians, particularly those who have child care expenses to bear.

For two children it would be another $426 a year, or nearly $3,000 a year in total.
Would the member confirm that those arrangements are the way they are? This payment on a basic basis for a family with two children earning $20,000 a year is $211.66 a month tax free. If the children happen to be under

seven the total amount spread out over the year is increased by $213 per child for each child under seven.

I know that a 30 per cent exaggeration is not his custom.
My specific question concerns those people at the lower end of the spectrum. We are not dealing with the credits for those who are advantaged and who have a higher income. I would like to focus on this $500 credit.
I am hearing from many single mothers that the $10 a week credit on the lower income spectrum is really not going to change their lifestyle. It is not a great incentive when they have a choice between either a welfare cheque or a work cheque for approximately the same amount. In other words, $500 is not that great an incentive. I know that in the hon. member's province there is a special pilot project going which will perhaps give some added training to those single parents at the lower end of the spectrum.
Is the member satisfied with that $10 a week? Does he not think that for that sector we should have been a lot more generous to move them from the welfare side of the equation?

of employment rather than receiving and accepting welfare. This $500 is important. It represents 5 per cent of income for a person making only $10,000 a year.
No, it is never enough. If you boil it down to a dollar and some cents a day or $10 a week or whatever, it is not enough. It is not a significantly large amount of money, but it is more than has been paid up to the present time. It is more than his government has ever done. It is moving in the direction of doing away with the welfare trap, of giving some recognition, however small, to those who prefer to work rather than living on welfare.

The special features of the Jobstart concept are those that teach the work ethic in a full-fledged employment
scenario. The participants are not called students but rather employees and they learn the disciplines of holding a job on a first-hand basis. In addition, of course, they receive general training in the fundamental skills and habits necessary to survive in the work force.
The innovative training program is also very cost effective for society because it has a high record of helping people break out of the welfare trap.
The Jobstart Program deserves a continuing place in the training structure of the Canada employment system.

After much consideration, the Government of British Columbia has determined that Canadian interests would be best served by Canada withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations and not signing a NAFTA.
It is clear from the actions of the Government of the United States over the past few weeks that it is not willing to live by the spirit of the commitments made in the Canada-U.S. Free Hade Agreement (FTA). These actions include the recent softwood lumber dispute and the Honda case, both of which are clearly politically motivated trade disputes that violate the commitment to fair trade between the two countries.

Through a good communications campaign and a willingness to consult, supermailboxes were a success.

Now, to the surprise of many, in the municipality of Matsqui in my riding Canada Post seems to have forgotten its own secret to success. In a veiy high-handed way Canada Post has decided to locate supermailboxes in the middle of people's lawns. I am not kidding.
A simple notice to say it is coming was issued. No consultation took place; no recourse was available. The next thing we know, trees were ripped out, holes were dug, a water main broken, Canada Post's reputation was shot, and 300 people were signing a petition.
Things are moving fast here, but what we really need is some common sense and some understanding. Residents and Canada Post alike want to get rid of the old green boxes and want some improved service.
I encourage Canada Post to stop its high-handed and arbitrary actions in the McMillan Heights area of Matsqui and meet with the residents affected to reach an amiable agreement suitable to all parties involved.
I have now been assured by Canada Post that it will meet with the people affected.

While attention is recently being focused on child sexual abuse in Martensville, Saskatchewan, the government's special advisor on child sexual abuse estimated that across the country some one-third of males and over one-half of females have been sexually abused at some time in their lives.

The government has ignored this advice and the plight of thousands of Canadian children. Instead, it has off-loaded billions of dollars in social programs and transfers to the provinces.

As I mentioned earlier this afternoon and as the minister knows, there is a very successful training program conducted by a volunteer community organization in the town of Oromocto called the Jobstart Program.
It has been designed primarily in an employment scenario to teach the work ethic on a broad basis and to provide a basic level of general employment skills to young Canadians.
The Jobstart concept has been uniquely successful with the continuing employment record of more than 70 per cent since its inception. Although the Canada Employment Centre has continued to support Jobstart, unfortunately the nature of this unique program apparently does not meet the present criteria of a national program curriculum.
Does the minister and the department support the Jobstart concept of general skills training in an employment scenario and, if so, will he initiate measures to have the Jobstart criteria included as an eligible and continuing program in the general Canada employment training structure nationally?

Oral Questions
He knows that in the meantime Canadian steel producers will be seriously harmed by U.S. trade actions while the panel decision is awaited and the prospect is that Canadian producers will lose further market share during that time.
He knows also that under the existing agreement it pays U.S. steel producers to launch trade remedy actions even if it is likely they will lose under the dispute settlement mechanism.
Is the government taking the occasion of the negotiations of a North American free trade agreement to correct the anomalies in the free trade agreement with the United States? Is it taking the occasion of the NAFTA talks to renegotiate those anomalies in the free trade agreement?

Essentially what I was saying in response to the steel matter was that the Minister for International Trade will support our steel industry with regard to that dispute.
I did not say, and he has not said, that we are going to go into a chapter 18 or chapter 19 mechanism. However, he has not ruled out ""initiating an anti-dumping or countervail claim"".
What I was speaking about was another chapter 18 decision which was just tabled about an hour ago. It indicates that non-mortage interest is now to be included in the CAMI instance and it will have a very good influence on the upcoming Honda decision. All of this is positive proof that the free trade dispute settlement mechanism is working and the over-all agreement is working.

If anything exemplifies the misuse of trade remedy law it is the threatened U.S. action against steel exports. We are not talking about CAMI. We are not talking about Suzuki. We are talking about steel exports. Yet there is nothing in the existing free trade agreement which prevents this kind of protectionist harassment.
I take it from the minister's answer that that is the reason he does not foresee the government will go to the binational panel. What then is the government proposing to do in the case of the steel issue? It says it is not going to the binational. It has no policy on how to support the Canadian industry and does it not acknowledge there are serious-

I would like to review the various steps that this government has taken in eroding family programs, particularly programs for children.
Government Orders
First of all, when first elected, you will recall, it killed the child tax exemption, an exemption which was an income tax deduction of $710 for those taxpayers who had children under the age of 18.
This change in the tax policy penalized middle-class families particularly. It was unfair to those families because those are the families who did not get the child tax credit. It also meant that taxpayers who did not have children were in effect paying the same amount of tax that those families paid who had very high child rearing costs. I ask, was this fair? I do not think it was.
The second step was that the government introduced the child tax credit. Of course, as it is wont to do, it said this was a way to transfer benefits to those most in need. We heard that theme again today. It is a theme we have to watch out for because if you look underneath that rationale, what it is saying is: ""We are going to take money out of general funds and give just a little bit of token money back to the very poorest people so we can say we are do-gooders"".
Only a part of the savings from the child tax exemption, which as I said really penalized middle-class families, went to the new child tax credit which was directed to poorer families, and it was not all that much money either.
During its first term the government also began its policy of partial deindexation. This has proven to be a very insidious, secret way of reducing the value of family benefits and also, I might say, of old age pensions. It applied this vote to the family allowance and the child tax credit. Over the years this means that the child tax credit will go down in value each year. By the year 2000 these credits will be quite insignificant in terms of that they can buy for a child or a family.
The third Conservative government anti-family policy was to destroy Canada's basic universal social program for families. Of course, I am referring to its action which in this bill will take away the universal family allowance program. First it did it by stealth and now in Bill C-80 it is having the final execution of family allowances, the final termination.
Canada's family allowance program has been a progressive social program that made us proud to be Canadians. It was recognized the world over as a very progressive kind of family program. It treated all children equally and it really recognized the importance of children to all Canadians, whether we had children or

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
not. It recognized that as a society we had a social responsibility to help care for the next generation.
My party I am proud to say pioneered this family allowance program. We felt very strongly that the family allowance originally should have been higher and would have been a very good way to compensate families who had children.
The family allowance went to all children. We know also that this is the only program where the cheque when it existed went to the mother. It was often the only cheque that many women received in their own name. In 1986, when the government tried to deindex and tax back the family allowance, we put up a big fight in this House. It was very, veiy difficult. I will be frank about that. Children, unfortunately, do not vote. Therefore, children do not count in the political scheme of things with this government.
When the old age pensioners came to Parliament Hill and objected to deindexing and were worried that there was a threat of universal programs being removed, in particular the old age pension, they fought very hard and won their point of view. It will be recalled that at that time the Prime Minister said, and he repeated it later, that universal programs are a sacred trust and his government would never affect universal programs. Unfortunately, as I said, children were the victims and he betrayed our families once again.
The government introduced the budget this year and Bill C-80 which we are debating today. It will terminate altogether Canada's wonderful family allowance program. It was not quite so wonderful this past few years because the government was taxing it back. We felt that also was an unfair measure because again families with children were being penalized, whereas those families without children were not treated in the same way.
Once again the government used the same rationale and would not admit it was doing this partly because of the deficit and partly because of its philosophy which is definitely against universality. It said once again: ""Oh, never mind. We are just doing this so that we can put the money in for the poor, for those who need the most benefits"".
I want to say that we certainly do not object to special child benefits that are targeted to low income families. They are always welcome and always needed. But I want to say that we object very strenuously to the termination of the universal family allowance program which was there for all of Canada's children and was a basic, solid social benefit as part of our social security system in Canada.
The new child tax benefit which is also proposed in this bill provides $1,020 per child for families earning under $25,921. It offers an extra incentive for parents who are working. This supposedly is to encourage people to go off welfare and seek work. It is rather a patronizing point, but it is also extremely impractical.
The government, for example, fails to say how these parents who have been unemployed, not through choice but because they could not find work or could not find work that would bring in enough money to feed their families, are going to find jobs. Also, how can these people even begin looking for work when no child care is available? This is the very government that has, over and over again, promised a national child care program and now refuses to do anything about it. It completely abrogates its responsibility.
Doing away with the family allowance means that all children of Canada, both now and in the future if we think to the years ahead, have lost a precious family allowance program, a universal program that the Prime Minister himself said was a sacred trust. So much for the word of our Prime Minister.
Conservatives also refuse to recognize that today the situation in most families, if it is a two-parent family, requires that both parents work. The number of singleparent families in Canada has greatly increased. This government refuses to acknowledge that there is a tragic lack of licensed day care homes or day care programs for young children. This means that many children are at risk. Many are in inadequate babysitting arrangements and many have no care at all. We know that latch-key children are still coming home from school to empty homes.
In both 1984 and 1988 the Prime Minister in his election campaigns promised faithfully-I can just see that solemn expression on his face-that he would bring in a national child care program for Canadian families.
June 9, 1992

He acknowledged to the women of Canada in particular that this was a priority need and a priority of his government. However, once elected of course each time the promise was broken and this was the lowest priority.
We now hear from the Minister of National Health and Welfare that the government will do nothing, it is not important, it is not needed and we are not going to ever have a child care program under this government. That is why of course we must change this government and change it to a party that has a long record of supporting universal, non-profit quality child care.

Most working families will have to continue to use unreliable babysitting arrangements. Let us look at those who have higher incomes and who are paying taxes. What happens to them? Of course they are the ones that government recognizes and will give special advantages to so that they can hire nannies. The wealthier families now have had the child care expense deduction doubled twice. It is now up to $4,000 to $5,000 that can be deducted from their taxes for any of their child care expenses for children under seven and between $2,000 and $3,000 for children a little bit older, under 14 years of age.
In contrast of course many single parent men and women have little choice when they have young children but to go on welfare because there simply are not the adequate reliable child care services available. If they are available, they are not affordable. The fees are far too high.
What does this government provide to parents that stay at home? We understand there is a new-maybe it is not so new-family caucus now that is reinventing the traditional old family values. They are fine and were fine in our parents' time but do not really recognize the real situation of families in this country today and the great diversity of family groupings as well.
The government did make a token gesture for a parent that stays home to care for children. This is extremely important work that should be highly valued. What do
Government Orders
they get? They get a token $213 a year for children under seven. I say it is a gross insult.
Millions were spent on two child care reports, first the K. D. Cooke report and then the all-party child care task force under the Minister of State for Transport. Both of these reports documented the very urgent need for adequate quality care for children.
We travelled this country many times and heard from so many groups the stories of what was happening to kids and the tremendous stress on families, particularly in the poorest provinces of Canada.
We recommended specific suggestions for a comprehensive national child care program. It was not as rich as I would have liked, but it was a lot better than what we have now. I see the former minister is in the House today. He took a long time to look at these suggestions and eventually he came up with some very modified proposals. Even those have been refused by this government.
Community groups across this country which are experts on child care have continued to advocate that we simply must get on with a program for Canada's children. This week the National Action Committee on the Status of Women made this one of its priorities.
I would like to go back to one of the main points of focus of Bill C-80 which is to establish the new child tax benefit. When it was proposed in the 1992 budget, it was said that this tax would be simpler, fairer and more generous. It is none of these. The child benefit is supposed to help low income families escape from poverty by providing a child benefit which will supplement the minimum wages if they should go off welfare and find a job that pays minimum wages.
How can this goal be achieved when there are no child care services available so a parent can start looking for work or perhaps get into training programs? We know the Canadian Jobs Strategy program has been cut by $100 million. How can this goal be achieved when parents on welfare really cannot find a job?
There are very few jobs around and most of those only pay minimum wages which gives the parents practically no advantage over their present situation. I do not have to say how much it costs to raise children today.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
The child benefit is based on what I would call an 18th century philosophy of welfare, which is of course the typical Tory philosophy on social welfare programs generally. It establishes two classes of the poor.
First of all, we have the working poor. They are the deserving poor. They are the poor who will get an extra $500 for their children if they go out to work. Then there are those who are on welfare. They are the second class poor. They are the poorest of the poor. There is no recognition at all of what their real needs are or why they may have no alternative but to be on welfare or why they are caught in the welfare trap which will go on from generation to generation because of inadequate social programs and few alternatives.
At the same time that this government is taking the family allowance away in this bill, we have to remember it is also taking away from low income families co-op housing programs which are desperately needed to have an affordable quality shelter for Canadians. It has terminated federal transfer payments to provinces for health care, for post-secondary education and for social services under the Canada Assistance Plan, which has been cut for three provinces. One million dollars was cut from the Canadian Jobs Strategy. All these moves will contribute to the poverty, the hardship and stress on children and youth in this country.
The Conservative philosophy of partially deindexing social programs, which incidentally has already reduced increases in old age pensions, also applies to these child benefits. It means the value of benefits will go down each succeeding year. Deindexing is a secretive Tory plot to gradually reduce the value of benefits. By the year 2000 many of these benefits will be practically out of existence or they will have very little value.
As New Democrats, we would have a very different approach. My time is almost up so I do not have time to outline this in detail. We believe that the first thing we must do to counteract poverty is to make every effort to create jobs. Full employment should be a major priority of government.
This means we must have government intervention. We must have government leadership. We cannot tie unemployment to the rate of inflation and interest rates and allow the unemployed to be the victims of a reverse
economic situation. It means that we must have not only jobs but we must have jobs with decent rates of pay and pay equity. Along with that must be quality, affordable child care, non-profit child care. This is the best antidote to poverty and to chronic welfare dependency.
We must maintain our universal social programs. We must reinstate family allowances so that children of all families will be recognized and so all of us who pay taxes will be contributing to the next generation. After all, these are the children who will be paying the old age pensions for their parents as they get older.
Children must have the care, love and opportunities to grow and develop in health. Children may not vote, I tell the Conservatives, but they must not be ignored. Canada must eradicate child poverty by the year 2000. This is not going to be done with platitudes and words. Jobs, decent family incomes and quality child care are the pillars to a better future for this and future generations of Canadian children.

I wonder if by that she means they would increase them right across the board, for people earning above $70,000 a year as well as for those earning less. If so, I wonder how much she would increase them.
There is only so much money available in any pot and particularly the present pot. If she was not thinking of increasing them across the board, would she have increased them more for lower income people than for higher income people? If she did that, her party would have arranged a system of graduated benefits, not that much unlike what we have.
I was also a little confused by the comment that one of the reasons she deplores the family allowance having been eliminated and replaced with this very progressive system was that under the family allowance the money was paid to the mother. Does she not recognize that under this new system there is a much more significant transfer of money within families to usually the mother, the responsible adult under the family allowance system, because the new proposed payment will also be paid through the existing family allowance system.
June 9, 1992

Would she not celebrate that move because it is a very significant transfer of the refundable child tax credit to mothers usually from the father in the family?

If he looks back at the ""blues"" he will see that when I mentioned it we had been-it was in the past tense-in favour, or would have liked to have seen family allowances raised. I was talking actually in past history terms.
It was Stanley Knowles who was one of the earliest activists and advocates for family allowances. Initially we saw this in those times and that is what I was referring to as being one way that you could share the burden, if you like, or the cost of raising Canada's children.
I do not happen to have children but I feel very strongly that I would like to contribute through the tax system to the raising of all-I cannot afford all-of Canada's children but certainly we should be contributing just as much as parents who are paying for their own children. That, I think, is a social responsibility. I was referring to that really in conceptual terms.
Over the last two platforms that we have had, we realized it was not possible at this time to raise family allowances. We have always said that any universal program is balanced out a bit through our tax system because those who pay more taxes, and the same goes for the old age pension, get the universal payment but they are taxed more for it.
I think the other point had to do with the cheques going to the mother. I know there were many women who spoke to this point a few years ago when we had hearings on child and family benefits. In a way I thought it was a bit sexist because there are many fathers who are also the main parenting person in families.
Perhaps we should not necessarily hold to that virtue. There is one thing I do agree with in the proposal for the present family benefit proposed under this bill and it is that it is monthly payments. I think that is a sound way because people have to pay the rent every month and they have to feed their kids. Waiting until the end of the year does not solve that problem.

As members will recall, the proposed child tax benefit program was announced by my colleague, the Minister of Finance, in his February 25 budget speech.
There is no doubt that benefit programs for children and their families touch all of us in one way or another. As the Minister of National Health and Welfare said when introducing Brighter Futures a call to action on behalf of Canada's children: ""We can only build a brighter future for Canada by cherishing all our children"".
I am very pleased that these two ministers and colleagues of mine have recently taken the type of actions they have, not only in developing this program but in developing other programs that support and benefit children.
These two ministers have been especially cognizant of the needs of families and they have listened very carefully to their colleagues in caucus. All of us appreciate very much the way they work with us to bring these changes about, particularly the ones we are talking about today.
In assessing the importance of this legislation I believe it would be useful to take a few minutes to look at what has gone before, to reflect on the evolution of federal child benefit programs, which began modestly after the First World War and took a considerable step forward with the family allowances program in the 1940s.
We will see a logical progression which brings us to the new child tax benefit program.
The concept of a family benefit related to children goes back as far as 1918 when an amendment to the Income War Tax Act introduced the child tax exemption of $200 for each child under the age of 16.
The importance of this step lies in the fact that it recognized in principle the income needs of families with children.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
In 1927 the child tax exemption was increased to $500 and extended to all children under 21. It was also at this time that the equivalent to married exemption was introduced.
These tax measures related to children continued to evolve in the twenties and thirties and were converted to tax credits in the early forties. At the same time the idea of family allowance began to surface. It was first raised in this House in February 1929 when a member made a motion to the effect that: ""The question of granting family allowances should be studied"".
The House of Commons select standing committee did consider the question of family allowances in 1929. Unfortunately the Depression of the 1930s, followed by World War II, postponed further consideration of such a scheme until the early 1940s when it was studied by the House of Commons reconstruction committee.
The work of the committee was guided by a policy which fell into three broad divisions: demobilisation and re-establishment, economic and employment aspects, and human well-being and health. The notion of a family allowance was seen to relate to all three of these areas. It would provide cash regularly to families who needed it most, creating a continuous demand for basic necessities which would encourage production and steady employment.
The federal government also began to think about a long-term social security plan for the country. This had been spurred on to some extent by the release in November 1942 of a report to the British Parliament by Sir William Beveridge titled Social Insurance and Allied Services. The Beveridge report proposed, among other things, a children's allowance to counter what its author saw as the failure of the wage system to take account of family size.
In December 1942 the Canadian ministers of pensions and health asked Dr. Leonard Marsh to develop a plan on social security. Dr. Marsh's Report on Social Security for Canada, popularly known as the Marsh report, was presented to this House in March 1943. Dr. Marsh believed that one of the major causes of poverty was the fact that wage earners with large families had insufficient earnings and that since wages took no account of family size the state had a legitimate role to play in adjusting disposable income to reflect family size.
We must remember that there were few social welfare programs in Canada in 1943. Assistance for needy families most often came from churches and private organizations. Although all provinces had introduced mother's allowances programs for women and children who were alone and in need these programs were so restrictive that they often excluded the very people that they were supposed to help.
Over all, the payment of a benefit on behalf of children was seen as an investment in the future of the country and particularly in the country's most valuable asset, its children.
The government announced its intention to introduce a family allowance in the Speech from the Throne in January 1944:
The family and the home are the foundation of national life. To aid in ensuring a minimum of well-being to the children of the nation and to help gain for them a closer approach to equality of opportunity in the battle of life, you will be asked to approve a measure making provision for family allowances.
Although the family allowance program was payable to all families with children regardless of income its main focus was to improve equity by assisting children in lower income families. This is clear in the statement made by the Prime Minister of the day in introducing the bill to Parliament. He said:
The adoption of family allowances means the recognition of the right of children of poor parents to what is already recognized as the right of children whose parents are in more fortunate circumstances -
Already this Parliament has recognized that, with respect to families, there is an obligation upon the state to assist in the upbringing of children. This has been done in the interests of the parents and the family itself, but more particularly in the interests of the children. But, up to the present time, that obligation has been recognized only with respect to the more fortunate in our country, those who already have an income large enough to be taxable to entitle them to exemptions according to the number of children in the family. In other words, where the need has been least it has already been recognized. The purpose of this bill is to recognize a similar obligation where the need is obviously greater than it is in the other cases.
It is interesting to note that although the debate was lengthy, and a look through the Hansards of the day indicates that it was also rather spirited, when the vote was finally taken there was not a single dissenting voice. Thus, in 1945 Canada had established a program by which the federal government could provide a supplement to family income. This was seen as a necessary and positive step forward in spreading the cost of raising children more equitably over the whole population.
June 9, 1992

Furthermore, this new benefit was intended to help equalize opportunity for all children insofar as the state was justified and obligated to do so.
The family allowance was established as a universal program. It was believed that providing the allowance to all children was the simplest and cheapest way of providing a supplementary family income. However, there was to be no duplication with the child tax credit. Therefore, higher income families who were eligible for the child tax credit would return some or all of the allowance at tax time.
At the same time, the family allowance provided a measure of equity to families whose incomes were below the tax paying level and therefore did not benefit from the tax exemption for children. In essence, we had a system of tax credits for dependants that gave equivalent benefits to all income classes, supplemented by family allowances which were income tested through the tax system.
However, the system that was required to adjust the family allowances to the income tax allowances for children proved to be unreasonably cumbersome for everyone-taxpayers, employers and tax administrators alike-in an era when computers were still the stuff of science fiction. Therefore, the tax on family allowances was repealed in 1947, tax credits were abandoned, and tax exemptions were reinstituted.
Over the years, further changes were made to the tax system with respect to families with children. In 1972 the child care expense deduction was introduced, recognizing the child care costs incurred by working parents. However, the Family Allowances Act was not changed significantly until 1973.
Interest in a new direction and emphasis for the income security system in the late 1960s and early 1970s resulted from a growing dissatisfaction with what was seen as a large and costly social security system co-existing with a disturbing incidence of poverty. A number of studies revealed a high degree of inequality in the distribution of income.
For example, the Senate committee's 1971 report, Poverty in Canada, emphasized the plight of the working poor who it said numbered close to two million in 1967. The report denounced the existing social security system for not providing more assistance to, and I quote, ""that
Government Orders
vast army in the labour force whose income is grossly insufficient"".
Thus, on second reading of the 1973 bill on family allowances, the then Minister of National Health and Welfare said:
The original family allowances program was introduced for the purpose of giving a maximum measure of income support to families to help ease the financial burden of bringing up children and to provide a measure of equal opportunity for children regardless of a family's economic situation. The objective of the new family allowance program is to provide a supplement to the income of Canadian families in such a way that those with the greatest need will receive the greatest benefit.
This approach provided the direction for subsequent child benefit measures adopted during the 1970s and 1980s and the greater focusing of efforts and benefits on low income families. I believe it is important to take note of the fact that while the new Family Allowances Act of 1973 maintained the broad concept of universality the selectivity of taxing the benefit was fully supported by this House.
The Minister of National Health and Welfare of the day acknowledged that the new program was designed to provide greater benefits to families with the lowest income. He said:
By taxing family allowances we will bring about a substantial degree of selectivity in the amount of the benefit because a large part of the allowance will remain in the hands of those who need it most -the lower income families who do not earn sufficient income to pay taxes or who earn just enough to be taxed at the lowest marginal tax rate. On the other hand, families in the higher income tax brackets will receive a benefit that progressively reduces as income rises.
Child benefits were again restructured in 1978 in response to the concern that there continued to be a disproportionate benefit to higher income families. For example, tax exemptions and deductions were of little or no value to low income families, many of whom had no taxable income.
To address this concern a new child tax benefit, the refundable child tax credit, was introduced and the level of family allowance benefits was reduced. The child tax credit program was designed primarily to provide assistance to low and modest income families. It provided a maximum benefit of $200 per child per year and the benefit was reduced for families with income above $18,000.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
During the 1980s a number of measures were taken to better target benefits to lower income families who needed them most. For example, the child tax credit was increased in 1982, 1987, 1989 and again in 1990, bringing it to a total of $559.
In November 1986 the government began prepaying two-thirds of the child tax credit to lower income families. In 1990 an additional $200 supplement was provided for children under seven years whose parents were not claiming the child care expense deduction. The limit on this deduction was raised by $4,000 for children six years and under and for children with special needs.
I think my hon. colleagues will agree that we can see a certain progression in the development of children's benefits in this country. When the family allowance program was introduced in 1945 it was done in recognition of the need to provide equality of opportunity to all Canadian children. It was introduced at a time when families were expected to deal personally with almost every contingency, no matter how serious.
If assistance was required in desperate circumstances it was expected that relatives, friends, neighbours, the community and the church would provide it. It was only after all these avenues had been explored and exhausted that a family received carefully rationed public charity, which incidentally was rarely in the form of cash.
The introduction in 1945 of family allowances, together with the unemployment insurance program, marked the beginning of the planning of a comprehensive social security system in Canada. With the creation of this new family benefit the state recognized and accepted its role and responsibility in sharing more equitably across the whole Canadian community the cost of raising our children.
We must continue today not only to share this responsibility but to ensure that those most in need receive the most assistance. This is the direction in which child benefit programs have been moving in Canada, and the proposed child tax benefit is a major step along this path.
The new child benefit addresses the changing circumstances of Canadian families in several ways. It simplifies the present patchwork of programs and benefits. Mr. Speaker, if you were following the long list of complicated plans we have in the present tax system you would agree that simplification should be a major goal of this government in every part of its endeavours.
The new benefit provides a supplement to the earnings of low income working families and it provides a greater responsiveness to individual family situations.
The key element of this program that makes it so different from all other programs we have had is that it is the first time in Canada that a social support program is delivered through the tax system according to income and is universally available to everyone. I admit that not everyone gets it every year, but it is available without application simply by filing an income tax form.
I would also like to add that a number of speakers on this bill have suggested that families with incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 will receive an increase of only $4 a month or $50 a year. These comments are misleading. Under the proposed child tax benefit families with incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 will receive an average increase of $250 a year in child benefits. This is five times more than the increase suggested by some members.
Under the child tax benefit a typical two-parent family with one child and a total income of $40,000 will receive an additional $300 a year in benefits. A single parent in the same situation will receive an additional $400 a year.
The child tax benefit will increase assistance to children by $2.1 billion over the next five years and about 80 per cent of this increase will go to families with incomes below $40,000. The proposed child tax benefit builds on Canada's social policy tradition. As a matter of fact, I believe that it is founded on values and principles very similar to those articulated when family allowances were first introduced in the forties. Such fundamental values and principles are the recognition of the interdependence of Canadians, commitment by the state to help families in the care and nurturing of their children, recognition of children as the future of Canada, the need to assure Canadian children of greater equality of opportunity.
I have no doubt that all members of this House will, upon reflection, agree that this is the only reasonable and just direction to take.

Duhamel (St. Boniface):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,INCOME TAX ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague for a rather comprehensive and in-depth address with respect to this bill and its background.
My concern is as follows. Yesterday I addressed Bill C-78, the omnibus bill that dealt with disabilities. While I was pleased to say publicly that there were pluses with respect to that bill, for example in the area of elections it will now be easier for people with disabilities to participate, there were also minuses, for example the direction to the CRTC with respect to closed captions was not clear and was not precise and had no timetables. I raised a more fundamental question. If you look at that bill again, I want to draw a comparison of Bill C-78, and the pluses that it brought forward in relation to what has occurred in that whole area. If we look at housing, for example, it has been seriously affected by the government's last budget, as well as a number of other areas. Are there really over-all pluses?
My question would be very similar with respect to Bill C-80. If we look at the pluses, there are some obviously. We had a family allowances program, we had a non-refundable tax credit as well and we had income tax deductions for certain child care. While we have retained the latter in this new legislation, my understanding is that we now have collapsed it. We have made it a bit simpler, if you wish, in that there is a program that replaces the other.
I applaud that because it is complex out there, not knowing exactly what you are going to be getting. I know that it will be paid monthly and that is going to be helpful. If we look at the last five, six, seven or eight years and the reductions in transfers to programs that affect children, and I am not even talking about the reductions in transfers for health and education or the caps on social assistance to provinces such as Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, if we look at it over all, if we control for inflation as well, my understanding is that there is not an over-all gain for the children of Canada.
If I am wrong, I would very much like to be corrected. I wonder if my colleague could answer that question.

I have a considerable difficulty with it, considering the role that his party when it was in government played in bankrupting this country. When we were as a caucus committee working to develop this program to find ways of making the government's contribution to families more effective and so on, we were extremely limited.
The first instruction we had from our hon. colleague, the Minister of Finance, was that we should do this without any additional money. Later on, when he brought the program forward, he was able to sweeten it with some $400 million, not by any means as much as we would have liked to have seen in terms of redirecting funds to families in need.
My hon. friend talks about our having to hold the line. Our government has for over seven years now held its expenditures below the rate of inflation, year after year after year. When his party was in government, over a 10-year period I believe the rate of spending went up an average of 14 per cent a year to the point where we were $200 billion in debt.
Now he is trying to suggest that when we are trying in a very constructive and careful way to make things a little better for families, because throughout the system we have had to tighten up in so many different places that somehow there is not a positive benefit. Certainly since our party formed the government in 1984 there has been no benefit to Canada of having been saddled with what was a $200 billion debt and from interest, additional loan has increased to well over $400 million now, despite the fact that our government has managed to improve the operating accounts so that there is now a surplus of some $12 billion a year as opposed to the $16 billion of operating deficit they were running under when they formed the government.
For him to be trying now to discredit this very positive action by relating to the stress that our country has been in in trying to cope with the debt and the size of the deficit that his party left us with I think is inappropriate in the extreme.

I am sorry that my colleague may have misunderstood my remarks. In fact I was trying to be sensible and sensitive and as supportive as I could be under the circumstances.
My colleague did not answer the question as to whether or not if one looks at the advances that have been made here, and I noted some of them, there is over all more money if one controls inflation and other factors if one goes back seven years. He simply did not answer the question.
I am rather disillusioned that my colleague should use facts that are inaccurate. I would have thought that coming from government, he would have access to the information.
I have a letter from the then Minister of Finance, the hon. member for Etobicoke Centre, indicating that the deficit at the end of fiscal 1984, and they came into power on September 4, 1984, was less than $168 billion. Now either the member knew what in the world he was talking about or he did not. I have that written document. I would like to point out that $168 billion is less than $200 billion.
If they are trying to suggest that they would have been more generous if the Liberals had done a better job is just not good enough. That was not what the issue was. He is trying to make political hay out of this. If he wants a political debate, I would be delighted to have a political debate on this or any other issue.
Is there more money now over all if one looks at the last seven years as a result of these changes? Yes or no?

Mr. Speaker, this is a pretty straightforward question, and I would like an answer. I do not want to know the total deficit or debt before 1984. If he wants to use those figures, then he should at least make sure they are accurate.

When expenditures are increasing at the rampant rate of 14 per cent a year, it takes some energy and will on the part of any government to turn it around and bring it under control and
certainly to drop it below the rate of inflation, which is what we did.
He asked the question as to whether or not there is more money or less money. In my own personal circumstances I would say that considering the increases in taxes that we have had to bring in and the cuts in expenditures, I have the gut feeling that I am less well off today than I was in 1984. I do not think there are many people in Canada who would disagree with that. How that is distributed certainly has a very severe effect on the family. That is why we brought this program in to tiy and make things better for families, particularly families with children.
I think that the real issue here is that we are focusing our efforts on improving the lot of children. I think that he and other members should applaud that in what are in fact very difficult circumstances due, in my view, entirely to the legacy of debt which his party left us.

Yes, it is, to enact the Children's Special Allowances Act and at the same time to repeal the Family Allowances Act as though the child is not part of the family, as though child poverty is not the consequence of family poverty.
Indeed Bill C-80 is an incredible act of sleight of hand. It is dishonest and mocks Canadians, especially the neediest Canadians.
The government is spending $500,000 to say this government package is simpler, fairer, more generous and more responsive. In fact many needy Canadian families will not see any increase in benefits at all.
This bill sells us something that was ours to begin with. It sells us child benefits and convinces Canadians they are getting a bargain. It pits the working poor against the poor who cannot find jobs. It pits child care against child poverty, oblivious to the fact that lack of adequate child care breeds child poverty. The government, through this bill, has turned its back on universality, a principle woven throughout our social assistance system to ensure there is no stigma attached to it, to ensure there is continuing universal support for it.
June 9, 1992

Since 1986 the Mulroney government has stealthily eroded the value of the family allowance by refusing to index it to inflation. The allowance lost ground and will continue to lose ground through the new child benefit package. These benefits will only be indexed for inflation over 3 per cent.
When the increase in the cost of living is lower then 3 per cent they lose benefits, getting no increase in family allowance. When inflation is higher than 3 per cent they will only receive the amount over 3 per cent. In times of inflation, high or low, they are clearly the least able to cope. Canadian poor are at the mercy of inflation.
The government adds another insult. It claims the benefit package is worth $400 million a year or $2.5 billion in five years to Canadian poor. Yet in the past seven years-and the figures speak very clearly-over $3.5 billion have been stripped from social programs by this federal government.
One of the best analyses of the dishonesty of the federal government's package comes from The Catalyst, a publication of citizens for public justice. It states in its April 1992 issue:
Under the current system the poorest Canadian families, those families receiving social assistance or unemployment insurance payments will not receive an increase in their benefits. Under the current system, these families receive annual family allowance payments of $419 per child, and a refundable tax credit of $601, for a total of $1,020 per child.
The new child tax credit will give them $1,020 per child, exactly the same benefit as the current system. The only additional funds are in the form of an earned income supplement for families who are employed and earn more than $3,750 annually. For every $100 earned over $3,750, these families will receive an additional $8, up to a yearly maximum of $500. Once annual earnings reach more than $20,921, the earnings supplement will be decreased and will disappear completely at the point where annual income is $25,921 or more.
Obviously this scheme does not give benefits to those families receiving social assistance or dependent only on unemployment insurance payments. What a sleight of hand.
The new package gives $1,300 less per year for the average family than if this federal government had not
Government Orders
whittled away the existing programs over the last seven years.
I submit the proposed child benefit package is not a bargain. The money it gives back to Canadians is essentially the same money the government has hoarded by hidden cuts since coming to power.
Through this package the government only provides a conveniently timed, camouflaged surge of benefits, no doubt to be eroded again immediately after it has served its electoral purpose.
The Mulroney government has proposed a new plan that looks good on the surface, just in time the government hopes, to dupe many families into re-electing the very people who have cut back their family support consistently over the last seven years.
The government has spent thousands, up to half a million, to advertise the child benefit package, making a key claim that the new plan is responsive. It will include immediate changes of benefits for the birth of a new child or other changes in family status. While this is commendable, it will not respond however to reflect the rising cost of living when under 3 per cent.
And not only is the amount of the benefit not fully indexed to inflation, the threshold income above which no benefits will apply is equally as unresponsive. Not only will the amount of support available to families decline constantly from the time the plan is instituted, but the number of families eligible for it will too. The new plan also does not take into account tragedies like job loss in the middle of a year.
The lack of indexation of the new benefit package shows that the government has ignored one of the key recommendations of the December 1991 report of the House of Commons subcommittee on child poverty.
The majority of membership in this subcommittee, I should remind the government, came from its own side. Thus the government ignored even its own members. I wonder how these government members of the subcommittee, including its Chair, will finally vote on this bill.
The government also flouted a second key concern of the subcommittee, that the regressive child care expenses deduction be replaced by a more responsive

Government Orders
credit which would actually benefit all needy families working or unable to find work.
The subcommittee proposed that the child care expense deduction be replaced by a refundable tax credit of 50 per cent of child care expenses, which should be payable in advance. But for those unable to put out that money in the hopes of a tax deduction a year later, there is no improvement. The approach recommended by the subcommittee would help the needy, the needier and the neediest.
The proposed new system is commendable-and I give credit where credit is due-in its component that provides income supplements for work related expenses. However, let us not forget that there are over two million Canadians who cannot find jobs. Many of them live below the poverty line.
The government has given more to those who have something but neglects to pull out of poverty those who are most deeply embedded in it.
This raises the question, naturally, of the government's aims in this new child benefit package. Is the government's concern the welfare of children, the support of parents, or the redressing of poverty problems resulting from failures of its social programs, or the ideological elimination of universality of the family allowance program?
Shall I remind the government that the family allowance program stemmed from a shared Canadian conviction ""that parents with children should pay less tax and should receive greater benefits than taxpayers without children, precisely because of the service they in the future render to society as responsible citizens and workers""?
The universal family allowance program already assures the most benefit will go to those most in need of it because it is taxable. In addition, it allows mothers a regular cheque which, for some women, is the only cheque they will receive during their lifetime.
If poor children are the true focus of this proposed program then why has this government failed to adopt a comprehensive plan of action to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000 as earlier resolved in this Chamber, in this House of Commons?
To sum up, Bill C-80 admittedly is simpler. But is it more fair? No. More generous? No. More responsive?
Again, no. This bill fails the test of fairness, generosity and responsiveness. It is at best a half measure.
May I give this government a prescription. If it truly aims to be fair, generous and responsive, the government should amend this legislation to index benefits fully to the cost of living, to include an increase in benefits for families on social assistance and unemployment insurance, to convert the child care expense deduction into a tax credit and at the same time retain the universality of the family allowance program.
Our nation's children deserve more than half measures. They do not deserve this sleight of hand. They are innocent and honest, wanting only to grow up safe and secure. Canada's children, the future of our nation, deserve our full commitment.

Duhamel (St. Boniface):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,INCOME TAX ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his very strong and comprehensive address on this particular question. He is obviously very knowledgeable.
I want to raise three questions if I might. I have some notes here and I want to make sure they are accurate. I am sure that my assistant who prepared them for me would like to have that assurance as well.
The notes read as follows: ""The government claims that child benefits will increase by $2.1 billion over the next five years"". Then there is an addendum: ""It is estimated that the government slashed child benefits by $3.5 billion between 1986 and 1991"".
My first question is: Are those the correct ballpark figures? If they are, they answer the question that my hon. colleague just a few minutes ago refused to answer by attempting to become rather political.
The other question I want to be absolutely certain about, because it seems rather contradictory to me, is it would appear that the program totally ignores the poorest children, those whose families earn less than $3,750 a year. I just cannot understand what the rationale for that would be.
The third point is that the government always-and lately more frequently-talks about controlling expenditures. My own thesis is that that those expenditures are controlled as a result of serious off-loading to the provinces. It simply transfers fewer funds for health, education and social assistance. Therefore, yes, the government controls its expenditures but it turns them over to someone else. It is as if I were to give my debt

It is understandable the previous member did not address the issue of the difference between the $2.5 billion in five years that this new program will provide to the Canadian poor and the $3.5 billion that this government has-I use the word advisedly-stolen from the Canadian poor. When Canadians are told of this basic analysis they will realize there is nothing new in this program. In fact, there is less.
On the question of whether, in fact, when one receives $3,750 annually, yes, when that income is reached by those receiving benefits from this program, there will be a decrease in benefits for every $100 more earned. In other words, the benefit will disappear from the benefit package program when the ceiling of $25,921 or more is reached.
That component is acceptable providing there is incentive to work. I must add and keep emphasizing there are many Canadians who cannot find jobs. They want to work and they will not benefit from this benefit package. That is a very fundamental question this government must address if the government truly cares for the children of our country.

Bill C-80, an act to implement the proposed child tax benefit is just such an act. It reflects the fundamental Canadian tradition of redistributing scarce resources for the general benefit of Canadians, particularly our children.
In the white paper on the child benefit, the Minister of National Health and Welfare noted that Canada's future well-being and prosperity depend on our children. They
Government Orders
are our greatest asset. It follows then that we must attend to their current well-being to ensure they lead happy and fulfilling productive lives. We must strengthen our efforts now.
Assistance to children is a continuing priority of the Government of Canada. This past December, the Prime Minister announced that Canada had formally ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention is aimed at protecting the rights of children around the world.
The Brighter Futures initiative announced recently by the Minister of National Health and Welfare further confirms this government's commitment to children, their parents, and care givers. The initiative is a series of steps we can take now in order to achieve a brighter tomorrow for Canada and our children.
The child tax benefit is one of those steps. When implemented, it will simplify the tax system and streamline and substantially enrich the government's support for families with children. Over the next five years the child tax benefit will provide $2.5 billion in increased child assistance.
This is a substantial amount especially given the pressures on the government's fiscal position. As a result, Canadian families of low and modest means will be better able to meet the challenges of their daily lives.
Let me emphasize that Canada's assistance to families with children is already among the best in the world. Indeed, assistance to children has long been a cornerstone of Canada's social commitment to its people.
Currently, the federal government spends $4.5 billion a year on the three largest and most direct forms of support to families with children. Those include the family allowances, the child credit and the refundable child tax credit.
Moreover, additional federal support to Canadian families is provided through the goods and services tax credit, the child care expense deduction and maternity and parental benefits under the unemployment insurance program. Under the Canada Assistance Plan the federal government also cost shares expenditures by the provinces and territories on social assistance and services, including subsidized child care.

Government Orders
To provide the context for the child tax benefit, I want to explain briefly the three major federal programs of support for Canadian families.
The family allowance, introduced almost 50 years ago in 1945, is familiar to most Canadians. Often referred to as the baby bonus, it provides $1.9 billion a year of net federal benefits to about 3.7 million Canadian families with children under the age of 18. Payments are about $35 per child a month for a total of $419 per year and are generally paid to mothers. To assist the government to control expenditures and better target resources, the payments are taxable and are partially or fully recovered from high income Canadians.
The child credit is an annual deduction from the federal tax owing of $71 for each dependent child 18 years or under at the end of the tax year. For third and subsequent children the credit is increased to $142. The accumulated net benefit of the child credit to Canadian families is $400 million. The credit has existed in one form or another since 1947.
Finally, to increase assistance to families with low and modest incomes, the refundable child tax credit was introduced in 1979. The credit has a maximum value of $601 and is provided for each dependent child age 18 or under at the end of the tax year. As well, a supplement of up to $213 per child under age seven is provided to families not claiming child care expenses. These benefits are reduced for families with incomes exceeding $25,921 per year. Total federal payments under the refundable child tax credit amount to $2.2 billion per year.
The 1992 report of the United Nations Development Program ranked Canada first in the world on a range of factors assessing a country's human development and quality of life. The federal programs I have outlined have contributed significantly in this regard.
Nevertheless, difficult living conditions remain a fact of life for many low income Canadian families. For these children we must do more to ensure that their parents have adequate resources to meet their basic needs. We must enhance our support to ensure that these children are raised in conditions that promote healthy development.
The child tax benefit will assist us to provide that enhanced support. In a moment I will explain how. However, I first want to focus briefly on the problems that necessitate its implementation.
As Canada's major programs of assistance for Canadian families have grown over the years, shortcomings have appeared. Accordingly, the government has been urged to improve this patchwork system of child benefits. In particular, two parliamentary committees, social policy groups outside the government and many individual Canadians have identified the following faults with our current system.
First, benefits are delivered piecemeal in three different ways and at different times of the year. This delivery patchwork is confusing for many Canadians because each program has different eligibility criteria. As well, for
600,000	higher income Canadians, family allowances must be partially or fully repaid to the government when they file their income tax returns.
Second, benefits are not targeted adequately. In particular, because family allowances are recovered on the basis of individual incomes, families with similar total incomes may receive different levels of benefits. Family income is a better basis to direct assistance to children most in need.
Third, independent support creates barriers to work for low income families. These families are faced with employment related expenses and a possible reduction in social assistance when they choose to work.
Finally, the delay in the delivery of the refundable tax credit is difficult in many modest income families. While it represents more than half of the federal child benefit, for many families it fails to meet their immediate needs. For example, although they must pay for the child's needs every month, parents may have to wait a full year to receive the full credit. As a result, many families sacrifice part of their benefits by resorting to tax discounters to obtain badly needed cash.
The proposed child tax benefit is designed to address these structural faults and strengthen the federal support for Canadian families. It responds to the recom-
June 9, 1992

mendations for change that have been urged upon the government.
The benefit is streamlined, responsible and better targeted. It provides enriched benefits that will be delivered on a more timely and less complicated basis. The increased benefit is a social dividend financed by the spending cuts the government announced in the 1992 budget.
Canadians believe that fiscal progress should result in increased assistance to Canadian families. Our government agrees. Over the next five years, the proposed child tax benefit will increase assistance to Canadian families by an average of $400 million a year from $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion.
Under the new system, the basic amount of the benefit will be $1,020 per year for each child. The current annual supplement of $213 will be continued for each child under the age of seven. Where no child care expenses are deducted, a $75 supplement will be provided for the third and additional children.
Low income families will also be eligible to receive an earned income supplement of up to $500. This means that low income families will receive up to $1,733 for their first child and up to $1,233 for each subsequent child. The child tax benefit will be provided to all families with annual incomes up to $67,000 per year.
For families with three or more children, the benefit cut-off will be higher than $67,000. The basic benefit will be reduced at a rate of 5 per cent of family net income over $25,921 for families with two or more children, and at a lower rate of 2.5 per cent for families with one child. The average annual benefits for families with incomes below $50,000 will be $250 higher.
As with other elements of the tax system, the child tax benefit will be automatically indexed to changes in prices in excess of 3 per cent. However, as in the case with the child tax credit which has been enriched five times since 1984, the benefits will be reviewed over time and adjusted as fiscal conditions permit. These previous enrichments have ensured that the level of federal child benefits paid to low income families have more than kept pace with inflation.
Clearly under the new system these benefits will be more fairly and effectively targeted than under the current system.
Government Orders
The greatest benefits will go to low and modest income families. About 80 per cent of the total increase in benefits will be directed to families with incomes below $40,000 per year.
Single parent families face particular difficulties due to their combined responsibilities of earning a living and caring for their children. To further assist single parents the equivalent to married credit will be continued for their first child. This is worth an average of $1,445 in reduced federal and provincial taxes for many single parents.
The government designed the child tax benefit to reinforce the incentives for low income parents to participate in the work force. Often they face financial barriers, such as employment related expenses and possible reductions in social benefits, which preclude them from seeking employment. Accordingly, a new earned income supplement of up to $500 will be available to working families who receive little or no social assistance.
I want to emphasize that the new child tax benefit will be progressive. Benefit limits will be determined according to family income not individual income. This means that families at a given income level will be treated the same regardless of the number of income earners. This will better ensure that the assistance be directed according to family needs. The new approach will also be simpler.
The three major programs of assistance to families will be consolidated into one benefit. This means that the three sets of delivery systems and eligibility criteria will be reduced to one. This will be much less confusing and time consuming for Canadian families.
To further simplify the system the payment levels will be calculated automatically. Parents will no longer be faced with completing separate schedules on their tax forms for child benefits, nor will they have to calculate the recovery of child benefits when they complete their tax return.
In addition, the new system will eliminate the waste and inefficiency of the current system. High income families will no longer receive payments that currently have to be recovered by the federal government at tax time. I am sure that all Canadians will be happy to know that this will simplify the basic income tax form.

June 9, 1992
Government Orders
The new child tax benefit will also be more responsive to family needs. Changes in family status, such as the birth of a child or the breakup of a marriage, will be reflected in adjustments to the monthly payments. This will be particularly beneficial for low income families who now resort to tax discounters to get an early payment of their year-end benefits to meet their immediate needs.
For example, the up to 16 month wait they currently endure to receive their child tax credit after the birth of the child will be reduced to one month. Benefits will also be quickly extended to newly arrived immigrant families with children.
The child tax benefit is a major advance in federal assistance for children. Members will be interested to learn that over 175,000 Canadians have responded to the government's public information campaign on the child benefit white paper.
Most comments have been quite favourable, especially concerning the targeting of money to children who need it the most. The government proposes to implement the child tax benefit on January 1, 1993, at which time the monthly cheque will be made to eligible Canadian families.
Monthly payments for the first six months will be based on family income reported for the 1991 taxation year. In July 1993 and each July thereafter payments will be updated to reflect information from the previous tax year.
To summarize, the monthly payments will provide assistance as it is needed to help with the expenses of caring for children. Approximately two million Canadian families with annual incomes under $50,000 will receive larger monthly payments.
Unlike the family allowance the new benefit will not be taxed or recovered at tax time. The single monthly payment will mean a system that is simpler, more efficient, and more responsive to the family's immediate needs than the current system.
To help ensure a more adequate standard of living for Canadian families of low and modest means I fully support this legislation and encourage all hon. members to do the same.

3913562,ca.proc.d.1992-06-09.4.1.1.18,1992-06-09,1e73027c-405a-4806-a0f7-4883a47a70f9,ca.m.6264,Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,INCOME TAX ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, I am here today to speak on the proposed Bill C-80 dealing with the child tax credit.
The proposed bill is intended to replace the current social welfare benefit system-including family allowances, the child tax credit and the non-refundable dependant child credit-by providing a single monthly payment to the recipients of family allowance.
In eligible cases the amount of the benefit will depend on the earnings and income as well as the number and age of children within the family. The benefit is to consist of two elements. They are a base amount of $85 per month and an earned income supplement which is not to exceed $40 a month per family up to a maximum of $500 a year per family, both of which are non-taxable.
The intention in creating the benefit was to target more generous financial assistance to low and moderate income families by allotting an additional $2.1 billion toward assistance programs over the next five years.
This proposal sounds too good to be true, because it is. I would like to know, where has the $3.5 billion that was snatched from the child benefits over the past five years gone? The government benevolently claims that: ""The poor people on social assistance will continue to get family allowance"". What has it done with the other benefits it was receiving? Are they all to be slashed?
In Canada today over 2.5 million people have been forced onto social assistance. This is a matter of crisis proportions. What will happen to them? What will happen to the assistance which provides the most basic necessities for the nearly 60,000 students who are parents?
Where do the refugees, new immigrants, and aboriginals on reserves fit into this bill? How will they be affected?
Moreover, the economic model proposed as a basis for Bill C-80 completely omits single parent households which rely on some form of social assistance. I would like to know why. I ask this question: why?
I draw the House's attention to page 4 of the research report, the Financial Implications of Child Support Guidelines. One of the methods used to estimate the costs associated with children was to ask: ""How much do parents spend on their children?"" How can anyone put a price on a child? All children are different. There is no norm by which to classify them.
June 9, 1992

The report indicates on the same page that the Department of Justice participated in the contribution to a group of specialists tasked with producing an independent review of the proposal. However, the results of their work have not been included in the report due to time constraints and fundamentally disparate views on the subject.
Forgive me, but I thought that the reason these specialists were chosen was to express their different views. Why then have their views not been published in the report? Why have the expert views of the department's legal specialists been stifled on the basis of time constraints? This proposed bill should not be a quick fix when dealing with such vital matters, when dealing with the future of our children.
Why does it hold back? Did the specialists produce a review so unflattering of government policy that the family law committee chose not to allow it the light of day? It is curious that while the views of the three economists chosen by the committee were included those of the legal specialists were not.
The government stresses that its social programs and priorities are committed to families and children, but the only priorities I can see are the ones set on the spending of another $500,000 on public relations to promote its image and longevity in government. The government places a high priority on creating a legal loophole for the wealthy. Yet on the other end of the scale it would have us believe that through its gracious benevolence it is providing more income for low income workers, claiming that families will have an additional $2 billion to spend in the next two years.
However, the grateful $3.67 extra a month will certainly vanish within the next 12 months due to inflation. The supposed long-term miracle the government is trying desperately to peddle is, if anything, a short-term fix only as far-sighted as the next election.
I draw the House's attention to page 4 of the white paper report, to an article that states, and I quote:
In choosing to work, low income families with children are faced
with employment related expenses and possibly a reduction in social
assistance benefits.
Government Orders
Why then does the government insist on burdening ordinary Canadians who struggle to build a better life for the family, to add insult to injury, with a lower standard of living for choosing to work? With all the money the government is reaping from here and giving there why does it not have the wherewithal to contribute at least some of it to the food banks? That is where more and more Canadian children are finding themselves.
It is due to this government that Canadians find themselves in want of the basic necessities of existence. When this government took office there was one, and I stress one, food bank in Canada. Today there are 292. It is time for this government to bear the responsibility for the impact of its destructive economic policies and put its support behind Canadians.
I see this bill as another quick-fix scheme that serves no useful purpose in resolving the growing incidence of Canadian poverty.

Gardiner (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,INCOME TAX ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to enter into this debate. I believe there is just a brief amount of time left before this House has the opportunity to pass judgment on this legislation.
We are debating a very important measure here today that was introduced by way of Bill C-80, which the government introduced as part of its budget procedures. It has been sold by this government to a large degree as an attempt to ease and simplify a very important component of many of our social programs in the country, namely the child benefit program.
It has been clear from many of the questions and comments raised in this House, as early as Question Period today, and from the comments from members on this side of the House, that this debate is about more than just a piece of legislation to arrange the regulatory and financial measures to provide the kind of benefits to families in this country that people have rightfully come to expect from the Government of Canada. It was brought on by the approach this government has taken in this legislation and in terms of many of the comments members of the government have made over the past little while.

Government Orders
If we examine some of the background of this particular legislation we can see that since the Conservative government came into office in 1984 it has cut family benefits dramatically. It killed the old income tax deduction of around $710 per child under age 18 and brought in a tax credit worth far less. It is now worth around $71 per child.
In the 1992 federal budget, the most recent one, the government announced an end to the existing family benefits, to be replaced with an extremely targeted so-called child benefit. The new benefit consists of a basic benefit of $1,020 per child with benefits being reduced at a threshold of net income of around $25,000. The bill and the measures that the government introduced went on to deal with a number of other issues in that regard.
What is wrong with the Conservative approach on this? We heard recently of what they call the family caucus or the family compact as it is more likely called. The vision of Canada that we see coming from some members on the government side is very right wing. What we are starting to see is that some members on the government side do not like the direction their own government is going. This is causing some dissent and members are obviously lobbying to try and have their agenda met.
While the Conservatives argue and want us to believe that this new child benefit is simpler, fairer and more generous, it is none of the above. The system means an end to universal family allowances and thus the end to the principle that the task of raising children is recognized in all families regardless of income level. The family allowance recognizes that all children, rich and poor-an important point-are of equal value to our society and its universality ensures that it is non-stigmatizing.
In the whole debate we have had from time to time in this country, this government has very surreptitiously, most people would argue, eroded the concept of universality in Canada. It would rather have us line up at the welfare offices and go down to the United Way to try and get help for our families. That is not the approach that we want to take in this country. It is a vindictive, nasty approach in a particularly sensitive and important field:
the whole question of the family support and support for children across this country.
For many women the family allowance was the only money they received in recognition of their unpaid work and valuable contribution to society. For many women the family allowance was their only independent source of income.
As well, the government is suggesting that the new system of child benefits is a simplified system that would make low income families better off. It always sounds good, does it not? The new system is comprised, it says, of four sets of benefits as opposed to the five in the old system.
The new system is so complicated that the government, not the individual families, will have to calculate the benefits. What is created, I suppose, is an additional bureaucracy for administering many of these programs. The government has gone about developing this, as I have said, in a vindictive and backward way in the delivery of these programs.
Let me quote from a document prepared by some of my colleagues. It is a very revealing document in terms of just what is behind this question. It raises the point of fairness. It states:
The new system is the first government benefit which distinguishes between the ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" poor. The $500 earned income supplement will add $500 to working poor families earning between about $10,000 and $20,921. This was described as an added incentive for social assistance recipients to ""get out of the welfare trap"". However, with child care costing between $6,000 and $12,000 per year, an extra $500 will not go very far.
That is an important point which was made by a previous speaker. All of us see it in our ridings, single parents, in particular women, attempting to get jobs. Who is going to take care of the child at home? We need day care programs as well as other programs. This government made a commitment at one time for a national day care system which it is now backing down from. We have seen many single parents attempt to get jobs, but how can we blame them if they do not when we add up the whole cost of day care and transportation. They cannot afford it.
In conclusion, this is legislation we do not need to see in this House. I am proud that our party did so much work on this issue. Let us make sure that the government members on the other side get the message tonight during this vote.

3913627,ca.proc.d.1992-06-09.5.1.1.7,1992-06-09,9215f31c-20f9-48ea-b0c0-7ecd25041e42,ca.m.8812,Mr. Steve Butland (Sault Ste. Marie) moved,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"that Bill C-327, an act to assist employees to purchase a controlling shareholding in the corporation that employs them and to amend the Income Thx Act in consequence thereof, be read the second time and referred to a legislative committee in the Economics envelope.
He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concurrence of the House to proceed with the full hour. It was much anticipated, therefore, I would prefer the full hour to just a half hour of debate.
The bill is C-327 and if I could read it into the record:
An act to assist employees to purchase a controlling shareholding in
the corporation that employs them and to amend the Income Thx Act
in consequence thereof.
It takes a long time for a bill to get to this point. It is particularly gratifying and I feel very happy and privileged to be able to speak to the bill at long last at second reading.
I believe the ability of employees to not only work in an environment but to perhaps own the working environment would be a step forward for the country. It is a much delayed step forward for the country since many other countries in the world already have legislation in place that allows employees to become majority shareholders in the company for which they work. We believe it is a democracy that can stretch from the shop floor to the boardrooms of the company.
In order for the bill to get to this point, it is indeed a trying circumstance. Certainly there have been several members who have written me personally and suggested that the bill would be out of order since only a government can propose a tax bill. Fortunately the legal counsel has indicated to me and to all those who might care that
June 9, 1992

the bill does not in fact increase income tax. It may in fact decrease income tax and therefore it is perfectly legitimate for a private member's bill to come forward as it has done.
May I suggest that this bill was supposed to be a forerunner rather than an after-runner to the Algoma Steel Corporation employee buy-out that has now been consummated and hopefully will lead to a positive future for Algoma Steel.
Given that fact it is unfortunate but nevertheless it points out that a corporation the size of Algoma can be purchased by the employees not without the consideration of, in this case, a parent company without the consideration and the spearheading by the United Steel Workers of America, not without the involvement of the Ontario government, not without the involvement of the banks of this country, and I must say not without the involvement of the federal government.
I will say in their participation in this restructuring and reprofiling of Algoma Steel, the federal government was reticent and hesitant and came in yelling and screaming, but in the end it did participate and I salute it for that. We do appreciate the fact that the federal government was an integral part in the final restructuring of the plan and I think the community of Sault Ste. Marie would also send out that thank-you.
Nevertheless, I want to say that this type of legislation has come its time. Rather than dealing with the issue on a crisis by crisis situation, or putting out a fire here in Ontario, or one in Manitoba, or one in British Columbia as there is every possibility that the governments of this country will have to face, rather than doing it in a piecemeal way, let us have a strategy in place so that we can deal with companies on the verge of closure, on the verge of bankruptcy, or in other cases where sometimes the parent company says: ""This company that we own is not making enough profits and we wish to cut the ties with the company"". In all of those cases and all of those scenarios it would be much better if we had legislation in place so that we can deal with it in an orderly fashion, rather than dealing with them on a one by one situation as in Algoma.
I want to point out, that this bill will give tax credits to the employers, to the employees, and to the lending institutions so that all the participants can become involved and form a partnership in the new company. It
Private Members' Business
does not pit one individual versus another. I think that is a key instrument of this bill.
In speaking to the cost of the bill, I want to say that if you deal with a situation like Algoma, it has cost the Ontario government millions of dollars. It will cost the federal government millions of dollars. It will cost the employees, collectively, millions of dollars: $2.89 per hour for every employee in the corporation.
There are sacrifices to be made by individuals and governments, and in this case so too for the banks. If the government were to say that this bill would be too costly, I suggest that the alternative is not acceptable to anyone. The alternative, if Algoma were to close there would be 5,500 to 6,500 affected, depending on the employment level at any one time. The cost to all levels of government-federal, provincial and municipal-would be astronomical. First of all, everyone would go on UI, and afterward, unfortunately, many would be on the social assistance program, which would be very difficult for the municipality, under terrible duress already. They just could not handle it, the impact upon a community like Sault Ste. Marie with that number of people being laid off in one fell swoop.
It was pointed out that a city of 80,000 population would decrease by 20,000. I think you can apply this scenario to any community, any constituency, any industry, small, medium or large across this country. May I suggest that from day to day to day we read in the newspapers that ""another company is on the verge of"", ""another company has already closed"".
This legislation would allow the people who work within that company-the owners, the employers, the employees and everyone-to get involved together, to take one last crack at making a company viable yet again. It is proven in the United States, Italy, Israel, Germany, and many countries across the world that employee ownership can make an unsuccessful company viable, successful and profitable.
All of us may be faced with that scenario in our constituencies. That is why I hope that all parties will set aside whatever differences they may have and see fit to support this bill that again speaks of new partnerships, really unknown to this point. In our community the unions, the two levels of government, the banks, the employer, and the employees, got together and made it

Private Members' Business
work. We are hopeful for the future. May I suggest once again that it was an ad hoc dealing with the situation rather than a strategic plan that can deal with the situation right across the country.
We suggest that government has to have a role. If it is to have a role, why not in the best form that we know, and that is the form of legislation? Put it in a legislative form.
The provincial governments in Manitoba and Ontario have what I believe is legislation in place or about to come into place whereby rather than acting against what I am proposing would be complementary to what I am proposing. This federal legislation could be put into place and not seriously take away or detract from provincial legislation. I think that should be pointed out here.
The corporations in the province can opt in or can opt out of the regulations in Bill C-327. I think that is important to point out as well. We are not stepping on jurisdictional toes by putting this forward.
If the company is allowed to proceed with this, it gives not only the community new life, but it also gives the company new life. It gives the community new life as it did in our community. It brought people together. It gives time for the community to, hopefully, diversify. It is a lesson for Sault Ste. Marie and it would be a lesson for many other communities. Kapuskasing is another recent example that was dealt with by the Ontario government, the employer and the employees. It was a totally different set of circumstances, handled totally differently by the governments. Why not standardize it? Getting back to my point, it gives an opportunity for the communities to realize that you cannot depend on one industry for your future. You must diversify. I do not want to paint this as a time-buyer, but it does serve that purpose.
I want to say that six or eight months ago when I was pursuing this without any bill in place, I asked the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology in Question Period if they supported the concept of employee ownership. They both replied that they did but ""it was up to him as to whether or not this government would support that. We do not
know what you want us to support. We like the idea, but we do not know what you are asking specifically"".
The specifics are now there. We are asking for changes in the Income Ihx Act. I think everyone puts their arms up in a bit of trepidation about taking on the Income Tax Act. I want to say that in the United States the handling of this legislation is much more convoluted than I am suggesting in this bill. It impacts on a whole series of statutes, regulations and income tax acts which I will not bore anyone with by reading, but I want to assure you that this is a much more simplistic way of dealing with the problem rather than the American style. I want to say that what the American Income Tax Act does is it facilitates and motivates people to participate.
I am sure the government will suggest that we have some legislation in place that will assist, but there is no facilitator and no motivator. It really gives no one the impetus to go forward and really pursue it.
With regard to Bill C-327, it would not be my first wish to have ministerial override, but I do not want to be politically naive. Perhaps it is a good idea in a private members' bill to say: ""The minister has to be convinced that this is a viable option for this small, medium or large company"". I think it is important that the government has that option. As I said, it would not be my choice but, under the circumstances, I think it is appropriate that I put that in.
I should also suggest, and I have mentioned it once before, that it should not be only for companies that are in dire circumstances like Algoma with $800 million in debt. Those are the most dire of circumstances. Perhaps we can address small, medium and large corporations, industries or businesses that have not reached that stage yet, where there is potential for addressing situations before they reach that degree of severity of economic hardship. The bill suggests a way of getting that under way is that at least 50 per cent of the employees have to sign a petition saying: ""Let us take a look at this possibility"". That is the way of getting it started. It starts on the shop floor with the employees and it ends with the minister. It runs the whole gamut, I suppose, of the political or non-political spectrum from grassroots to the people who make the decisions in this country.
June 9, 1992

I hope that it can appeal to employees and I hope it can appeal to the government.
How common is employee ownership in the United States? As of 1987 it was estimated about 7,000 to 8,000 U.S. companies had employee stock ownership plans with approximately eight million worker participants. About 1,000 to 1,500 of these companies are 51 per cent to 100 per cent owned by their workers, who probably number around one million. Perhaps as many as another million workers are in firms that are 20 per cent to 50 per cent employee owned. About 100 to 250 employee stock ownership plan firms are the result of worker buy-outs of failing companies or successful subsidiaries of large concerns.
As far as political endorsation and non-political en-dorsation, I am glad to say that our local chamber supports it. I am glad to say the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is actively looking at the bill now and I hope to get the financial institutions to take a look at it because, as members know, this bill will come before us again in the fall. I hope in the summer months to build up some national support because I think it is a cause that can be readily supported by all areas and sometimes provide a new direction. I think everyone knows a new direction is required because perhaps what we are doing right at this present moment is not that successful.
Far be it from me to read endorsations from the United States, but I want to say in the United States as unlikely an endorser of this motive was ex-President Ronald Reagan. I am not so sure I should say this but I can use it to my own advantage. I quote:
Could there be anything but widespread misery where a privileged few control the nation's wealth, while millions laboured for a pittance, and millions more were desperate for want of employment? It should be clear to everyone that the nation's steadfast policy should afford every American of working age a realistic opportunity to acquire the ownership and control of some meaningful form of property in a growing national economy.
I think the ex-President is saying: ""Yes, I endorse employee ownership"".
A more likely endorser was a gentleman now deceased on the opposite end of the spectrum, Hubert Humphrey.
Capital, and the question of who owns it and therefore reaps the benefits of its productiveness, is an extremely important issue that is
Private Members' Business
complementary to the issue of full employment... .1 see these as the twin pillars of our economy: full employment of our labour resources and widespread ownership of our capital resources. Such twin pillars would go a long way in providing a firm underlying support for future economic growth that would be equitably shared.
In closing, this bill is social democracy in action. It does empower the workers. It empowers the workers though not at the expense of anyone else. It is a shared ownership of a small, medium and large corporation business industry and I would encourage that the government side and the Official Opposition support this.

Vincent (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance):,Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister; Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating the member on his decision to introduce a bill to promote employee shareholding in the corporation that employs them.
I agree that in some cases such participation may lead to increased productivity and as a result help strengthen our global economy. However, although enhancing cooperation between company management and its employees is praiseworthy in itself, I do not think it would necessarily be wise to adopt Bill C-327.
I would like to take this opportunity to give hon. members my views on the bill and help them decide whether the bill is acceptable in its present form.
Perhaps I may clarify the contents of Bill C-327. The purpose of this legislation is to help employees purchase shares in the company that employs them.
To that end, the bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that employees and the employer may include in deductions from taxable income 50 per cent of their investment in an employee share purchase plan and 50 per cent of the interest paid to a financial institution for the purposes of such plans. To take advantage of these tax incentives, employees must purchase a controlling shareholding in a given corporation.
Hon. members may recall that in 1984 the previous government, in a document entitled Gain Sharing for a Stronger Economy, proposed a program that would provide a tax credit, shared between employees and employers, for the percentage of the profits allocated to employee compensation.

Private Members' Business
The purpose of this program, like most employee ownership plans, was to improve labour management relations and increase employee productivity. Further analysis of the proposal raised some doubts as to whether those objectives were realistic. The proposal, which was not well received by labour and management circles, was dropped by the government and replaced by other policies.
At this point I may add that the Income Tax Act now includes provisions that provide incentives for employee investment. More specifically, the government encourages employee investment by giving preferential tax treatment to employee share purchase options and the labour-sponsored venture capital corporation plan, which was enhanced in the last budget.
Combined with the lifetime capital gains exemption, these programs offer employees a strong incentive for investing in Canadian corporations, without introducing a bias in investment decisions.
I may add that the provisions relating to national labour-sponsored venture capital corporations restrict the percentage of the assets of such corporations that may be invested in a single business, thus reflecting the old adage that warns against putting all one's eggs in the same basket.
In the case of Bill C-327, the eggs include not only the employee's investment but also his job. I think hon. members will agree it would be inappropriate for the government to urge individuals to take such risks.
I would also like to point out that a number of provinces already have programs under which employees may purchase shares in the corporation that employs them. The federal government provides passive support for these programs by administering them under the tax collection agreements and by not counting the province's contribution as taxable income. In some cases, investments under these programs may be eligible for RRSP treatment.
Eliminating initial tax incentives like the ones proposed in Bill C-327 was one of the main thrusts of the 1988 income tax reform. One of the primary objectives of the reform was to encourage decision making in terms of economic merits as opposed to specific tax benefits. Achieving this objective involved eliminating a number
of special tax benefits that were only available to a small group of individuals.
The resulting broadening of the tax base made it possible to reduce income tax across the board. In addition to introducing greater fairness, this approach, with its broader tax base and lower tax rates, has the advantage of not influencing investment decisions and thus encouraging long-term economic growth.
Bill C-327 does the opposite, in that it would encourage the use of public funds for the benefit of a small group of individuals who wish to acquire a controlling interest in the corporation that employs them.
There was another reason for restricting the use of initial tax incentives like those proposed in Bill C-327. Experience, both in this country and abroad, has shown that a considerable share of the tax credits used in this way is applied to activities that would have taken place even if the tax credits had not been available. The activity directly due to these incentives is often insignificant. Furthermore, such tax incentives often tend to have a poor cost-benefit ratio, in terms of achieving the desired objectives.
This brings me to my other point. The adoption of Bill C-327 could have a major impact on the deficit, since this generous tax treatment might encourage many businesses to restructure their employee compensation plan so as to take advantage of this incentive. Given the importance of controlling the deficit, it would be necessary to raise the taxes of all other Canadians to support the stock acquisition plans.
In this regard, it is important for my colleagues in the House to realize that Bill C-327 proposes income redistribution, to some extent. I wonder whether such redistribution is appropriate, in view of the lack of evidence to support the alleged benefits that would flow from the bill, if adopted.
In conclusion, I would like to congratulate my colleague on taking the initiative to present this bill in the House. I believe that I speak for all Canadians when I say that increasing the productivity of our workers and improving labour-management relations are important factors in helping this great country to succeed.
June 9, 1992

Nevertheless, I really fear that Bill C-327 would not necessarily do much to achieve that. Not only would it be costly and unfair but it would not reach the objectives for which it was designed.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to discuss this issue in the House and I hope that my colleagues can use this information to make a justified, fair and equitable decision when the time comes to vote on this bill.

Marie. The bill deals with the whole question of employee ownership, which in Sault Ste. Marie and in the Algoma district we see as the only solution really to the Algoma Steel problem which faced us one year ago last February.
On that cold winter morning we were notified that Dofasco had a debt amounting to some $800 million at Algoma Steel. I must say there was great concern. We had just been through a long and costly strike in the summer and fall of 1990. We faced the prospect of the company going into receivership and the complete destruction of the economic viability, not only of the company, but of Sault Ste. Marie and the Algoma district.
As we look back at it now, in some ways it is miraculous that the working together of Dofasco and Algoma Steel personnel with United Steel Workers of America, the banking institutions and the two senior levels of government, a new Algoma has arisen out of that situation with everybody suffering, as the member has said, massive losses. The workers lost some $2.82 an hour in wages. The banks have had their equity or their investment chopped. Dofasco has lost most of its equity position.
It is hard to know whether this was inevitable or whether it was just a combination of circumstances. Clearly if there is any way for this company to survive, it is with worker ownership.
The steel industry is in a terrible situation. It went through great hardship in the United States during the 1980s when it went from about 500,000 employees to 180,000. We are going through that dramatic restructur-
Private Members' Business
ing now. The only thing is that if the governments in this country get involved in the direct financial support of the steel industry, it means that those companies will be subjected to a countervail by the United States steel industry. They are probably going to be subjected in the next couple of weeks to an anti-dumping duty just because the United States companies want to protect themselves.
The kind of massive financial assistance by all levels of government in the United States has not been provided to Canadian companies. That is not to say that the Government of Canada will not lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the Algoma case because all the losses will be written off against the taxes of the main financial banking institutions that have massive profits against which to write them off.
It does seem to me that for many industries the idea of employee ownership is very desirable. I do not presume to suggest what that exact mechanism is. Clearly government incentives are one idea.
I look back at the budget that was delivered here in the House of Commons on February 15, 1984 by Marc Lalonde. In that budget he said: ""I am therefore proposing today to encourage this process with tax assistance for a new employee profit participation plan. The government will provide a tax credit of 10 per cent of the profits shared under the plan; 60 per cent of the tax credit will go to the individual workers, 40 per cent to the employer. The employee profit participation plan is designed to complement the collective bargaining process, not replace it. Experience has shown that to succeed, profit sharing cannot be a substitute for competitive wages"".
We are talking about profit sharing. Mr. Lalonde proposed a whole series of tax incentives to encourage profit sharing.
The ultimate objective is to lower the tension, lower the adversarial situation which exists in many industries between employers and employees. Surely there is no way to do this better than through employers and employees owning the company.
If you cannot make the company competitive when the employees own it, you probably cannot make it competitive anyway, assuming you have good management in each case, and it is an industry which is properly capitalized and modem enough in structure.

Private Members' Business
A few weeks ago we had a conference in Sault Ste. Marie on the future of Elliot Lake. One of the principal speakers at the conference was from Tembec which is a diversified forest products company in northern Quebec. I was very impressed with not only the employee ownership in that situation but the attitude toward training and retraining of the workers. Its average training amounts to some 84 hours a year where the Canadian average is only some two hours.
It was the company that stepped in in the Kapuskasing situation where there was an employee buy-out. I was very impressed.
I think profit sharing has a long way to go in Canada because we do tend to have very adversarial relationships between employers and employees, although I do think that the hard, tough economic times that we face right now perhaps reduced that to some extent.
Employee buy-out is one mechanism. Employee participation in profit sharing is another way. Assuming that the Tory government will allow this bill to go to committee, it would be a very worth-while experience to review exactly how the incentives would be provided, whether they would be adequate or perhaps how costly they would be. I think that is the kind of thing we would learn in a committee study of this bill.
I hope the government will support the bill going to committee. I think it is an area that must be further explored.
I do not expect this government to be very generous in encouraging employee ownership or employee participation but I think it is something that is going to happen. There are many industries in this country that are going to have great difficulty surviving in the kind of modem global economy in which they are competing with low-cost producers in other countries. We must have the very maximum of co-operation between employees and employers.
There is a great value in this bill going to committee to see the details of how it could work and how well it would work. I hope that enough government members will support it to see it studied in committee. Perhaps this is the final solution and it can become the law of the
land. If that happens and it is judged by the committee and the House to be the solution, that is great. If it is not perhaps it can be amended, or perhaps the government will ultimately see that there needs to be a mechanism for employer ownership so that it is necessary to operate with the ad hoc arrangements which we had in Kapuskasing and Algoma.
The bill should get the support of the House to go to committee for a very thorough study. We are going through a change in industrial relations in this country and in the world. Employer-employee ownership is one mechanism to ensure that many of our companies, especially our resource companies, survive in this country.

This bill proposes a 50 per cent tax deduction for investments made by employees, employers and financial institutions to finance employee takeovers of the businesses for which they work.
When assessing this bill we should examine it from various perspectives. Is the proposal good for the employees? Is it good for business? Is it good for taxpayers? I have asked myself these questions and have come to the conclusion that on the whole the proposal would not represent a clear step forward.
I shall now elaborate on why I have reached that conclusion. First, consider how this proposal would affect employees. Canadian employees work hard for their money. Out of their pay cheque they must provide for their current needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation and, if they are lucky, perhaps some entertainment. The remainder of their hard-earned pay, when set aside in the form of savings, provides for the future. Employees must decide where the best place for that nest egg is.
Each individual is different in that respect. Some are prepared to take substantial risks in making investments, knowing that high rewards often accompany high risks. Others place a premium on security, sacrificing a little return in order to sleep soundly at night in the knowledge that their money will be there when they need it.
June 9, 1992

Neither the government nor I can tell these employees as a group where it is best to place their savings. That decision depends on the individual's own experience, character and perspective.
However, a 50 per cent deduction sends a strong message that the government views a particular investment, acquiring a controlling interest in the employer company, as the preferred alternative. The bill suggests that the program is intended for cases in which the financial viability of the employer is in some doubt. Such turn-around situations constitute high-risk investments, not necessarily bad investments but certainly not everyone's cup of tea.
The government should not lure employees into a risky investment with a 50 per cent tax deduction when the employees' instincts and analyses would lead them in a safer direction. Even in the absence of a tax inducement many employees may find investments in their employers to be a good home for their savings. Clearly, the government should do nothing to stand in the way of such decisions nor discourage them through punitive tax treatment.
Just as clearly the tax system should not favour a particular risky type of investment, as this bill proposes. The tax system should play a neutral role if it is to serve the employees of Canada well.
I would now like to turn to the question of whether this proposal would be good for business. The idea of employees acquiring control of their employer's business is in vogue at the moment. A recent Globe and Mail article dealt with what it described as the largest experiment in worker ownership in North American history, which is the employee acquisition of Algoma Steel Corporation Limited. Therefore, it is understandable that this bill is sponsored by the member who represents Sault Ste. Marie, the home of Algoma Steel.
When the results of this experiment are in it may turn out that employee ownership was the ideal business solution for Algoma Steel. Certainly the employees' union representative held out high hopes. Mr. Leo Gerard, the Canadian president of the United Steelworkers of America, is quoted as saying that the Algoma restructuring ""shows what imagination and a willingness
Private Members' Business
to take risk can accomplish. High value-added production and a well-trained labour force need not be unrealized dreams or academic exercises"". Cuts in wages and benefits were necessaiy to make the package work and this may well have been facilitated by the involvement of Algoma's employees.
Employee ownership may turn out to be the ideal business solution for Algoma Steel. It will not be so in all cases in which businesses are faced with a decision as to change in control. Existing owners may be best placed to continue operating the business given their experience and the stake they already have in making the business work. Alternatively, an outside group constituted of neither employees nor existing owners may bring fresh ideas and new business connections and therefore offer the greatest opportunities for success.
The very complex question of who is best placed to control a business so that it works well for its employees, customers and shareholders is usually answered in a simple fashion. Existing owners when faced with an offer for acquisition of control will consider whether the terms of the offer are attractive. When considering multiple offers they will decide whether the most attractive one is sufficient to convince them to relinquish the control they have. Generally, the most attractive offer will come from the source that has the best plan for the business. If existing owners have the best plan they will accept no alternative offer.
If one group is provided with tax support for their offer while others are not the decision will be tilted in a direction that is not necessarily best for the business. For example, if employees are provided with a 50 per cent tax deduction available neither to existing owners nor to outside groups, employees' offers will be attractive even if they do not make the best business sense.
We all wish to ensure that the best business decisions are reached when questions of corporate control arise. When a business thrives Canadians benefit, as employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders or simply through participation in a prosperous economy. Therefore, we should all agree to avoid using our tax system in a manner that would lead to bad business decisions in the important field of acquisition of control.

June 9, 1992
Private Members' Business
A level tax playing field is essential if we are interested in business success. Unfortunately, this bill would tilt that field.
Finally, let us consider what is best for the taxpayers of Canada. Certainly, a 50 per cent tax deduction sounds very attractive but it would be available only to a select group, the employees of target companies and others who helped finance the take-over. There are millions of Canadians who are not in the labour force, who are unemployed, self-employed or employed in the non-corporate sector. There are millions more who lack the means or the desire to invest in their employers. None of these Canadians will benefit from the proposed tax deduction. Yet these same Canadians will be called upon to foot the bill when it comes to replacing the lost revenue from this new tax deduction.
Is it fair to ask the large majority of Canadians to pay higher taxes so that a select few can benefit from a 50 per cent tax deduction on investments that may pay off handsomely? I would say no.
In summary, whether this House considers the bill from the perspective of the employee, the business or the taxpayer it will find some problems. I am confident that the House will display its usual good sense in disposing of this measure.

Gardiner (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to participate in this debate, which is limited in time, on an excellent initiative from one of my colleagues, the member for Sault Ste. Marie.
This is an example of initiative taken by a private member. As most people who follow the proceedings of Parliament will know, one way that private members, members not in government, have an opportunity to present proposed legislation and to develop some ideas is by way of a private member's bill.
This is one particular bill where there is reason enough, I would hope, from the government side and all members of this House to vote on favourably when it does come to a vote and to send the bill to committee. Given the nature of the subject of this bill, it would present an excellent opportunity to review a very exciting and interesting subject matter.
Of course I am referring to the bill presented by my colleague, Bill C-327, and I will read the title which will explain it further. It is an act to assist employees to purchase a controlling shareholding in the corporation that employs them and to amend the Income Tax Act in consequence thereof.
Basically, it is an opportunity for us to develop in Canada a formal and structured process for employee buy-outs or to provide incentives that would make it viable as an attractive option.
This bill presented by my colleague would be the first federal legislation to specifically encourage or facilitate employee ownership. That is an important concept for us to look at.
I could go on, as some members probably have, given the difficulty that our economy is facing in Canada, and particularly in the manufacturing sector, given the pressures of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which many have labelled a failure, and of course the plans by the government to get our country into a trilateral free trade agreement.
But leaving those arguments aside for now and just talking about the whole nature of the development of industry and business in Canada, and indeed throughout North America, it is clear that those modem and progressive corporations are taking a look now at being successful. And how is it that they are successful?
One of the ways they are successful, and we all know this, is to ensure they have a valuable and trained work force and given the future outcome of this particular bill, an opportunity then for those employees to share in the ownership of a particular industry. It is those innovative and new ideas that are the kinds of proposals that really do make for a successful and progressive economy in North America.
We do have some examples across North America and here in Canada on employee ownership. One of the examples cited by my colleague is a company by the name of Weirton Steel in Ohio which was to be closed in 1982 by its parent company because of low profits. The employees decided to purchase the plant which accounted for one-third or 8,400 of the total employment of that local community. Since the buy-out the plant has performed relatively well, especially in view of the depressed market for steel. We all know, of course, about the debate between Canada and the United States now on that whole particular field.
June 9, 1992

In raising that specific example, the point is that it has been demonstrated that a decision to close a plant or a facility does not necessarily mean that the operation is economically non-viable.
Business decisions are made for a vast number of reasons, not always because the plant is not profitable. We have seen a number of such transfers given our branch plant economy in Canada. We have seen the closure of branch plants in Canada and movement to the United States. That is clearly an example where employee ownership might play a role in terms of the development of industry in Canada.
Mention is made in the notes about Kapuskasing. There is a very recent success in an employee buy-out and of course in my colleague's riding, there is Algoma Steel.
It is important for us to think about that because it gives workers the opportunity to share in the development of that particular plant or industry in that sector. One comes to mind. In Saskatchewan I believe there is a brewery owned by the workers which has had incredible success, if I recall from one of the business programs that was on. It is an example of the kind of ownership route I think we ought to try to take our industry in giving the employees an opportunity to have that share in the ownership and in the direction of a firm.
I might add that in my mind it is probably the subject of another bill, legislation or debate about Crown corporations. In many ways we might need to take a look at how to get our Crown corporations to be responsive to the needs of consumers. It has been a tool that really has been accepted by all parties in Canada. It has been a tool for economic development, much abused I would say by Liberal and Conservative governments. It is an abused model that can work.
We have to ensure that when we use the services of either CN or Petro-Canada we are getting something out of it or that there is a clear return to the public treasury. I do not know if at times we have been successful at showing that. In any case it is along the same lines, I suppose, of employees having some say in the development of those particular operations.
This bill will go some distance toward dealing with the issue. It deserves the support of the government, at the
Private Members' Business
very least, to vote and pass the bill. Then we could get it to committee where there could be a fascinating look at the whole concept of employee ownership. This bill could spur that discussion. In committee there could be very reasonable discussion. There could be witnesses from a number of these plants and facilities where it has worked.
Let us hear from the opponents of the idea who do not think it will work. Let us hear from the chambers of commerce and the trade union movement as to their views. It would be a very interesting study. That is reason enough for the government to tiy to move this legislation through and into committee.
Let me just mention a few other points in the bill just for detail so that the people who read this debate later will have some background. Part of the bill's plan is for half of the employees' or corporation's contributions plan to be deducted. Borrowing by a plan's trustees to purchase shares would be made easier by allowing lending institutions a tax deduction of half the interest earned.
The bill requires-and I think this is important-that the plan be agreed to by all parties involved: the management and the shareholders. Of course the Minister of National Revenue must agree in terms of the implications on the Income Tax Act in this case. Most important, we are seeing some support of initiatives in this particular case.
This particular initiative brought forward by my colleague has been endorsed by many groups including the Sault Ste. Marie Chamber of Commerce and various labour groups. Obviously there is the work here. I hope members of the public after hearing, will write their letters of support to the member for Sault Ste. Marie urging government members and other members of the House to support this legislation.
It will be a real opportunity for employee ownership whose time has come and for Canadian employees to be given the opportunity to save their jobs and work together to keep Canada strong.
I would encourage the government to offer its support to this bill, to send it to committee where all these issues could be surveyed and to say yes to a good idea from the member for Sault Ste. Marie.

I begin by thanking the hon. member for raising the issue of improving the relationship between management and labour. This government shares the hon. member's concerns that to remain competitive we need increased co-operation between labour and management. This will be critical in the long-term growth of the Canadian economy.
As members may be aware, Bill C-327 recommends that the Income Tkx Act be amended to provide a 50 per cent deduction from taxable income for employee and employer investments in employee share purchase plans and on interest income earned on loans by financial institutions to such plans. It is important to note that the purchase of shares is not enough. Under this proposal employees must in fact acquire control of the target firm.
Mr. Speaker, as you will no doubt recall, a similar proposal was put forth by the previous government in 1984. That program would have provided a tax credit shared between employees and employers for employee remuneration paid in the form of a percentage of profits. Like the current proposal, the objective of that plan was to enhance worker productivity through improved relationship between labour and management. You may also recall that both labour and management groups expressed dissatisfaction with that proposal. After careful study by this government the plan was rejected.
This should not come as a surprise to anyone who is aware of the objectives that this government espoused in tax reform. As members are aware, one of the primary objectives of tax reform was to encourage decisions based on economic merit rather than special tax preferences. This was accomplished by the elimination of numerous preferences, preferences that in many cases were available to only a small group of people. At the same time many deductions were either eliminated or replaced by credits.
The combined effect of this base broadening permitted the reduction of tax rates. As a result many Canadians,
particularly low income recipients and seniors, enjoyed a reduction in their tax liabilities.
Most important of all was the fact that tax reform was a major step in reducing the distortions in economic decision making through the income tax system. This broad based, low rate approach to income taxation left savings decisions undistorted thus encouraging the longterm growth of the economy.

As we know it is Canada's fourth largest industrial employer with 78,000 employees working today in Canada.
This industry is comprised of 4,300 different establishments, which means that the average work force in each one of these establishments is under 20 employees. This industry is really a Canadian industry. It is 96 per cent Canadian owned. A lot of them are family owned and have been in business for many years.
What has happened recently is a disaster. Like many of our other industries the printing industry has been hit very hard by the recession, but even worse by free trade.
Last year my province of Ontario lost 5,500 printing jobs. There is 14 per cent unemployment among printers themselves. In the rest of the country we lost 4,700 jobs in just one year in this industry which is quintessential^ Canadian. In just one year, last year, we lost 10,200 jobs. The people who work in this industry are proud and fine people.
June 9, 1992

What has this done to our trading relationship with the United States? We do about $750 million annual trade both ways with the United States, but our deficit in trade with the United States in 1988 was $106 million. Last year it was $332 million. This was an increase in our trading deficit of 213 per cent. This is not good for Canada. The loss of jobs is not good for Canada. There is the loss of foreign exchange.
Now why has this happened? The printing industry has analysed its plight. It cites the high Canadian dollar. It says that under free trade because the industry is small, under 20 employees per firm, the industry needs it more than the five year phase-out of tariffs under the free trade deal. The printing industry asked for the 10 years and did not get it. So consequently, it has been left at a competitive disadvantage. The higher taxes in Canada are cited, including lower capital cost allowances to invest in new machinery and equipment.
One of the interesting facts is the actual working of the free trade agreement itself under the country of origin markings. Since free trade, because of this factor alone $160,000 in sales and 1,700 jobs have been lost.
The U.S. laws are more stringent. They are enforced with greater zeal and there is a buy American program. Our printers simply want a level playing field. They are prepared to compete but they are not getting it from our laws or from our enforcement of the free trade.
We have to support our industry. It has come up with its own buy Canadian program, a printed in Canada logo, proudly Canadian. This is the industry's answer to the buy American program. Let us get behind our printers and give them the support that only government can and which they so richly deserve.

order requiring that the country of origin be marked on some imports when they come into Canada.
As regards the marking of printed material, requirements are as stringent in Canada as in the United States. Generally, there should be a country of origin marking on all stationery items, lithographic prints and printed matter.
In response to the concerns of the Canadian Printing Industries Association, our officials have undertaken a review of how we enforce the marking of imported goods order.
We are working in particular on administrative directives regarding the size and location of the country of origin markings as well as on amendments to current exemptions for printed matter.
We expect these guidelines to strike a balance between the Canadian requirements and the American ones. We met with the Canadian Printing Industries Association in April to give a progress report on this.
Before any change is implemented, the importing community and the printing associations will of course have to be advised of the changes we plan in terms of the enforcement of the marking requirements.
As far as the enforcement of the program by Customs is concerned, I can assure you that our officials enforce the order most cleverly.
Moreover, complaints from the Canadian Printing Industries Association have been investigated and, when required, corrective measures have been taken.

I received a very unsatisfactory answer. It was unsatisfactory not only to myself, but also to many Canadians across this country and especially people who are unemployed.

June 9, 1992
Adjournment Debate
The figures announced that day gave the unemployment rate at 11.2 per cent for the month of May. Now the prospect of finding a job in my province of Prince Edward Island is even worse because the unemployment figures there are 19.1 per cent. That is the highest monthly unemployment rate ever reported by Statistics Canada in my province. There is a personal face behind all these statistics.
People need jobs. They need jobs for their self-respect and for their dignity. Certainly these people are looking to the federal government to change some of its economic policies because these policies simply have not worked. Although inflation is important, job creation must also be a part of the federal government's economic strategy.
Perhaps more than anyone else in this country, Canadian youth is paying the price of this government's economic policies. The unemployment rate among youths in this country is 17.8 per cent. There are 114,000 fewer young people employed this year than in May of last year. Right now many students are looking for work and they have little or no hope of finding summer jobs.
In Atlantic Canada the youth unemployment rate is 30.3 per cent. That figure is unacceptable. I am astounded that this government does not recognize the need to act on this very serious situation.
Many of these students were planning to work this summer to pay for their expenses at college or at university next year. This government has simply let them down because it has not taken any action to provide the much needed jobs.
At the same time this government is hurting students in other ways. It has not recognized that the cost allowance for students under the student loan program has not been increased since 1984 even though tuition fees and other expenses continue to go up every year.
I want to end by saying there is no question that we need a change of leadership. We need new economic policies. We need policies that will create jobs.
For the sake of all Canadians, let us hope that this change comes sooner rather than later.

The government cares about the difficult situation in which Atlantic Canadians find themselves. That is why the government commits $425 million on average every year for regional development projects in the Atlantic provinces.
Furthermore, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency continues to draw up and implement programs that promote economic development in the Atlantic region. By the end of March 1992, a net amount of $745 million had been committed in grants and contributions under ACOA's action program.
The government developed strategies to rebuild and diversify the fishing industry in the Atlantic region. Under the Atlantic Fisheries Adjustment Program, the Government of Canada will commit a total of $584 million to the fishing sector; $120 million will be allocated to a program to help fish-processing plant workers adjust; $146 million will be spent to help diversify the region's economy; $150 million will be used to reconstitute the fish stocks; $130 million will be allocated under the Labour Force Development Strategy to community development programs and projects intended to help older and aging workers adjust.
Finally, under the Labour Force Development Strategy, unemployment insurance funds for labour market programs have increased 280 per cent, from $500 million in 1990 to $1.95 billion in 1992. These funds will be used to help the unemployed acquire new skills and to encourage the private sector to provide more training for its workers.
