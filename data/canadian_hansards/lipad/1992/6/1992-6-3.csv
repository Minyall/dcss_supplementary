Sudbury is green and getting greener every day. Lands once barren and devastated are covered in grass and trees; all this due to the co-operation of all within the community as well as with the help of all levels of government.
First, Sudbury's efforts were recognized in Ontario and in 1990 Sudbury was awarded the Lieutenant-Governor's Conservation Award. Again in 1990 Sudbury received the Government of Canada Environmental Achievement Award.
Earlier this year Sudbury's work was recognized by the United States and received the Chevron Conservation Award, and now the world recognizes Sudbury's achievements. Sudbury has become a world leader in vegetation enhancement.
All Canadians can be justly proud of these outstanding achievements and of the international recognition. Congratulations Sudbury.

Abusive men
are most likely to kill their partners when the women attempt to leave them.
Shelter workers and others who have helped battered women have also been threatened, beaten and killed. A Liberal member of Parliament, without consulting the organizations involved, published the addresses of all the shelters for battered women in his riding. Women's organizations wish to hold the member for Broadview- Greenwood accountable.
Women's organizations who help battered women are the experts on this issue. I urge all members of Parliament to consult with these women's organizations in their ridings before sending out any material dealing with violence against women. This recent action which puts abused women and children at further risk could have been completely avoided.

O. 31,BREAST CANCER,,"Mr. Speaker, this year alone there will be almost 16,000 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer and 5,200 women will die of this disease in Canada.
We cannot understate this problem. Breast cancer today is a crisis of epidemic proportions, and yet it is still being largely ignored.
According to the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, breast cancer research is severely underfunded. In fact the Medical Research Council only spends $1 million a year out of its $182 million research budget to combat a disease that affects one in nine women. The National Health and Research Development Program spends a ""whopping"" $40,000.
I suspect these figures are correct because when I contacted health and welfare for confirmation it would not release any figures to me despite the fact that it had them. The reason for this was that they had to be cleared by the director of the department.
Could it be that the government was too embarrassed to tell us the truth? It is time that we recognized the scope of this problem and allot the necessary funds to it.
When the government can find $20 million for ad campaigns, I am certain it can do more to combat breast cancer. If we are really interested in equality for women then the logical starting point would be to ensure basic equality for the health and welfare of all our citizens.

O. 31,HUMAN TISSUES AND ORGANS,,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Law Reform Commission of Canada released paper entitled Procurement and Transfer of Human Tissues and Organs. The document contained several important recommendations regarding this vital medical practice, among them that organs and tissues for use in transplant or research should be obtained through donation rather than purchase.
I believe this recommendation is excellent and I call on this government to act upon it. Besides the moral argument for respect for the living and the dead, there are very sound practical reasons for this recommendation.
Canada has an impressive track record for blood donations. We do not pay for blood, and thus generally those who donate do so for purely altruistic reasons. The United States health care community is forced to pay for certain blood products. This has created a market where people who are knowingly unqualified donors can sell bad blood for the sake of personal gain or compromising their own health for money.
The same holds true for organs and tissue. People should be donating these for the purpose of preserving and protecting life. I support the commission's call for making the purchase or sale of human bodies, organs and other non-regenerative tissue a Criminal Code offence.

An example of this is that lots of people want to work in Canada where salaries and wages are the highest in North America.

The OECD claims Canadian farmers receive subsidies totalling $8.8 million. It has been calculated that this figure is five times the actual support level. The OECD assumes that any amount above the world price for any product is a subsidy.
In the world market, the so-called world price of most commodities is far below the cost of production because
of subsdized surpluses. The Canadian domestic price is higher than the world price because the world price is rock bottom.
If we use the OECD's rationale, we could say that a Canadian factory worker is being subsidized by the Canadian taxpayer because his or her wage is higher than the world salary rate. The OECD's definition of world price misrepresents the real picture.
Canadians receive the best value in the world for food in terms of price, quality, wholesomeness and safety.

We set out in the budget of 1991 to bring down inflation so that we could bring interest rates down and keep them down. As of today treasury bills are trading at 5.95 per cent, one of the lowest levels in over 20 years.
That is a clear indication that if the fundamentals are right and the initiatives are in place it will spur economic activity, particularly in the manufacturing and processing sector.
If productivity is increased you are then more competitive. You can then compete for those markets abroad, not only in the United States, but also in other countries of the world. That is what my colleague, the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology, is working at.
On the training and retraining side, the Minister of Employment and Immigration has expanded the budget for training and skills upgrading.
Those are all important components of a rational, realistic approach to economic recovery. That is what we are following.

Yes, it is our intention. We think that there has been historic progress made on these matters, not simply in the establishment of the inherent right, but also in the recognition by aboriginal peoples that that must be exercised within Canada, that there must be other recognitions of the sovereignty of Canada, that the right would be inherent, and most important, the agreement by all parties that there would be a three-year period before which anyone would take it to court.
That should give a great deal of comfort to everyone. It gives us three years in which we can work out by negotiation, not by court decree, not by the decision of politicians or by native leaders, but work out by negotiation the form of aboriginal self-government.
The one other thing I should say has to do with the word ""agreement"" coming out of the process that I am chairing. It is understood by everyone that any conclusions we come to at that table have to be approved by respective governments. So in a sense, there is no formal agreement, but there is a willingness around the table to work to secure the agreement of governments to the proposals that have been the subject of consensus there.

In fact, the grain is moving out of the country and we have the possibility of setting an over-all record for grain movement and exports for this crop year.

We have extended considerable credit to the Russians to buy our grain, in fact on a per capita basis, more than any other country except Germany.

Joe Clark (President of the Privy Council and Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs):,Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs; President of the Privy Council,ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS,THE CONSTITUTION,PROGRESS REPORT,"Madam Speaker, I rise to report to the House of Commons on the Canada round, on the distance we have travelled on the road to constitutional renewal, and on the distance we must still go to succeed.
At the invitation of the Prime Minister during 19 days of meetings in seven cities across Canada, ministers and aboriginal leaders have met to find ways to move this country forward.
I believe we are closer than ever to healing the wounds that bind us, to keeping the country that unites us. The progress we have made is unprecedented.
We had set May 31 as a target to conclude, but in Toronto we agreed that we had come so far that we should continue. Our purpose is agreement on all aspects of the Canada round, and that goal is within reach. We agreed in Toronto to a pause to consult, to gain some perspective, to identify areas where compromise might occur.
We have all learned hard lessons from the past. We have realized that we cannot make Canada more inclusive unless the process to get there is inclusive as well. We have all realized that no single part of this country can move forward in isolation and that the Canada round is necessary not just in name but in substance. We have all realized that no single part of this country can move forward in isolation, that a Canada round is necessary not just in name but in substance. We have all realized that closing doors does not open minds. So we are discussing a wide range of issues today: equalization, a new Senate, a common market within Canada, a new relationship with aboriginal peoples.
Nothing is agreed yet. There will be no final agreement until there is full agreement on a full package of change. But we are on the way to real change.


Routine Proceedings
I will not review in detail every issue we have discussed, but I want to report on the major issues. Although serious questions remain to be resolved, the progress we have made is without parallel in the constitutional history of Canada. The glass is much more than half full.

First, we have reached consensus on ways to make Canadian federalism more flexible and more effective. That includes explicit recognition of exclusive provincial jurisdiction in eight areas that we believe are best handled locally-forestry, mining, tourism, housing, recreation, and municipal and urban affairs, labour market training, culture.
In the special case of culture, the Constitution would also explicitly affirm that the federal government would maintain national cultural institutions and granting programs. Any federal-provincial agreements in these areas, and in immigration, could be protected by the Constitution and thereby shielded from unilateral change.
That would also be the case for agreements respecting regional development. Powers made available to any one province would be available to all. The Constitution would constrain the federal government from using its spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
If provinces want to opt out of new national shared-cost programs, they could do so, with compensation, if they undertake programs compatible with national objectives.
The Constitution would protect Canada's transfer payments from unilateral change. The commitment to national economic infrastructure and regional development to reduce disparities would be strengthened. There would be a requirement of regular consultation on equalization.

The fundamental objectives of the Canadian social and economic union would be entrenched in the Constitution. These would include social services, education, protection of the environment, the goal of full employment, of a reasonable standard of living, and a commitment to strengthen the Canadian economic union
through the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital.
There is agreement to repeal the federal power of disallowance and to limit the federal declaratory power.
Second, there is consensus on a new, more inclusive vision of the country.
We have agreed on a Canada clause that would guide the courts in interpreting the Constitution, a declaration of the fundamental features of this country, of Quebec's distinctiveness, of Canada's linguistic duality, of aboriginal rights and responsibilities, including a new third order of government, of our democratic values, of the equality of women and men, of cultures and races, of the provinces in this federation.
We are recognizing the distinct society of Quebec and ensuring that provincial governments have the means to express their identity and goals.
We have agreed to open a new partnership with the aboriginal peoples of Canada, based upon a mutual respect that involves the recognition of their inherent right to self-government within Canada. That idea is not new. The Iroquois Confederacy and other aboriginal governments practised forms of democracy here before most European countries did.
Nor should the idea cause alarm. There are forms of aboriginal self-government now in Canada and they work better than the colonial systems which have created such despondency and such despair among Canadian aboriginals. The difference is that now those governments would be rooted in the Constitution.
The right would not be contingent, nor delayed. It is agreed that all parties would choose to wait three full years before that right was taken to court. That would give everyone time to begin to agree on what self-government would mean in particular communities, and to agree on what it would not mean. This three-year period ensures that the definitions can be worked out by agreement, by negotiation, not by the courts.
Existing provincial and federal laws would continue to apply until aboriginal governments have the authority to adopt new regimes which would operate within the Canadian system but would reflect aboriginal reality. The charter of rights would apply as it does to provinces.


Existing treaty rights would be protected and interpreted in a manner that is just, broad and liberal, taking into account their spirit and intent.
There have also been undertakings by the provinces with respect to land and the maintenance and services that would allow the federal government to include all aboriginal peoples, including the Metis, in section 91(24) of the Constitution.

Third, we are well on the way to improving substantially the national and federal institutions of Canada.
The Constitution would finally entrench the composition of the Supreme Court, including three civil law judges from Quebec. The appointment of Supreme Court judges would be based on lists submitted by the provinces.
First Ministers' Conferences would be strengthened as instruments of Canadian co-operation and the Constitution would require an annual meeting of Heads of Government.
On the Senate, we have not yet settled the basic questions of the basis on which the Senate is chosen, or its powers. But a great deal is agreed. Senators would be directly elected. A system of proportional representation would be defined by Parliament to ensure that the Senate would fully reflect the diversity of Canada. The new Senate would ratify federal appointments or reject them. It would have a 30-day suspensive veto over supply bills.
There would be guaranteed representation for aboriginal Canadians. On issues of French language or culture, a double-majority rule would apply.

On all of these issues there is broad agreement on the principles and on the essence of the proposals. In many areas exact legal text has been agreed word by word, line by line.
The work of the Beaudoin-Dobbie committee has been an invaluable guide in our discussions. In many cases the specific language has been borrowed. Where we adopted a different approach, for example, in describing the jurisdiction of the provinces, I believe there was agreement among the federalist parties whose unanimity gave such authority to the report of Parliament.
Routine Proceedings
There has been extraordinary agreement. But it could all come to nothing because these discussions are not about one item and not about one agenda. This is a Canada round and we need agreement on the whole if we are to have agreement on any parts.
A question of critical importance to Canada is our ability to have the kind of common market in our country that has allowed Europe to offer such tangible benefits to its citizens. When Canada was formed trade was in goods, and the barriers to that trade were brought down by the original Confederation agreement. In that same nation-building spirit we must reduce Canada's own barriers to the free movement of people, capital, services and goods.
Two other major issues stand out: the Senate and the constitutional amending formula for changes to national institutions. I do not believe we can reach agreement on either unless we reach agreement on both. I am confident we can. But that will require flexibility and vision on the part of everyone who wants this country to continue and succeed.
Three Senate models are being considered: equal representation of provinces; equal representation of regions; and equitable representation. All models share the principle that a new Senate must be much more broadly based. All models have aspects that commend them to serious consideration by provincial and federal governments. Each model obviously presents difficulties for others.
Those who argue the absolute equality of provinces put that forward as a principle of a federation, equal in importance to the principle of representation by population. Not everyone agrees and there is equally genuine concern about a reform that would allow six provinces representing 17 per cent of the population to stop or to appreciably delay decisions of a democratically elected House of Commons.
The federal government has said that if there is a consensus in the country on a particular model we could accept that model. However, if it were to be composed on the basis of the equality of provinces its powers must be much more limited than if it were more broadly based.
We need a system that represents the different parts of Canada better but we also need a system that works, reforms that will improve government, not prevent it.


Routine Proceedings
In Toronto I put forward some views on the powers I saw as being appropriately associated with the different models under discussion. I hope this may provide some basis for agreement. So far there is no consensus on the model or the powers of a new Senate.
We must find a consensus or this whole Canada round will fail. Everyone has agreed on Senate reform. The question is whether provinces who have hard positions now are prepared to find some way to agree and to make the Canada round whole.
I believe that if we can find an acceptable model for the Senate we can find agreement on an amending formula.
Sometimes we might wish that we were a simple country: one language, one culture, one clear identity. But that is not who we are and has not been for centuries. We are a complex, accomplished society, whose success depends on our respect for ourselves and our respect for others. If that mutual respect was important in the past, it is even more essential in the modem world in which we must co-operate and compete.
These present constitutional issues are of crucial importance to Quebecers who must decide whether to stay in Canada or not. They are of crucial importance to aboriginal Canadians who have been left outside longer than anyone else. And they are for western Canadians who have felt shut out of national decisions.

We all understand that the only way to achieve our goals is to achieve them all together. But there is more to it than that. Issues which interest Quebec are of profound importance to eveiy other Canadian because if Quebec rejects Canada in October, every Canadian will suffer, materially and for generations.
Aboriginal issues are of profound importance to Quebec because if we can establish an acceptable framework for self-government that can lead to greater certainty for Quebec and more harmony in pursuit of the goals of Quebec.
Institutions which give Canadians a sense of belonging to their country strengthen the whole country. We need each other after the Constitution too, and the respect we show each other now will make it easier for us to make progress together later.
Generosity is not a luxury in Canada. It is what keeps us together as a community, just as the absence of generosity could break us into bitter pieces.
I am encouraged by the sense of generosity I have found around the constitutional table, in this House and in this country. Our real challenge now is to find the ingenuity and the generosity to make the Canada round work and to make Canada work.

We support him without reservation in his efforts on behalf of the government to bring the provincial and federal governments to agree on a series of proposals that could break the constitutional deadlock.
Of course we on this side of the House are watching him with some trepidation and even impatience. It is still good to keep in mind that back in April 1991 the Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada submitted not only a procedure for resolving the constitutional impasse but also a nine-point program that the Liberals thought would settle the constitutional issue fairly and equitably.

Nevertheless, I would like to draw the minister's attention to some points that we consider absolutely fundamental. I will quote what the minister himself said in his speech a few minutes ago: ""The constitutional developments now under way are of the utmost importance for Quebecers. Secondly, they are also very important for native people, who have felt excluded for a very


long time, and finally for westerners who also feel left out of national decisions"".
If you allow me I will return briefly to each of these three points. We Liberals believe that it is absolutely essential in this constitutional round to give Quebec back its veto on constitutional issues and amendments. That is why we proposed a constitutional amending formula that would ensure a veto for the government and people of Quebec.
We think that the minister will have failed in the discussions now going on if he is unable to convince all his provincial discussion partners of the absolute necessity of an amending formula that guarantees a veto for Quebec.
Secondly, we want to recall-

It is absolutely essential that it be fully understood, as this round cannot only be a Quebec round but ought to be a Canada round, that we do something for the aboriginal people.
I heard the minister saying here today, and I will quote him again: ""We have agreed to open a new partnership with the aboriginal people of Canada based on a mutual respect that involves the recognition of their inherent right to self-government within Canada"". Then he went on to say: ""That idea is not new, nor should the idea cause alarm"".
It is quite clear that the Liberals profoundly believe the time has come to recognize the aboriginal right of self-government within our Constitution. For us, there is no alarm. We are very concerned when on the one hand we see the minister speaking and being very open and generous in order to achieve this and on the other hand we see his colleague, the minister of health, on TV making all kinds of difficulties or so-called difficulties about this very simple fact that ought to be part of this current negotiation round.
We are hopeful that every Canadian from every political party and every level of government will be generous enough to understand and accept the wording that has been put in the Beaudoin-Dobbie reports in relation to aboriginal issues.
Finally, the third component of what we think is essential as part of the Canada round is a tangible progress in reforming the Senate in a way that would be
Routine Proceedings
satisfactory to the legitimate aspirations of westerners and people of less populated provinces, who think that the overwhelming representation of Ontario and Quebec in the House of Commons makes them a smaller part of the decision process in Ottawa.
We Liberals believe that there ought to be a reform of the Senate that will allow a better representation, if not in the House of Commons then certainly in the Senate, in order to meet these legitimate aspirations of these provinces.
I want to be quite clear that the Liberal Party, under its leader, has made a series of suggestions regarding the Senate. We made these suggestions thinking that the west and the Atlantic provinces would be well served by this. In the Beaudoin-Dobbie report we dissent in relation to the Senate because we felt that the level of representation could be improved on what was suggested by the government and more particularly we felt that if we are talking of an elected Senate and a more equitable Senate, it ought to be an effective Senate also.
We felt that the proposal of the government was not going far enough in the directions of an effective Senate. Frankly, we are not afraid that the House of Commons would be paralyzed because there would be a more effective Senate.
We believe that if there is a certain price to pay in order to meet the legitimate aspirations of westerners and Atlantic Canadians it ought to be paid.
We are saying that the minister ought to work diligently to convince the representative of the provinces who are meeting with him that they have to give a veto to Quebec on the amending formula. He has also to convince his counterpart to respond in a positive fashion to a reformed Senate which seems to be needed and desired by the Atlantic provinces and the western provinces.

Finally, for everyone to win in this constitutional round we think it is essential for the Government of Canada to clarify its spending power and a new, more efficient, and functional distribution of powers to the federal and provincial governments and also to strengthen the federal government's position in the economic field.


Routine Proceedings
While we want this constitutional round to please Atlantic Canadians, Quebecers, Ontarians, and westerners, there must also be something for those who believe in a strong and effective central government for Canada. We think that depends on strengthening section 121 of the Constitution.
We were pleased with what the minister said about this desire to ensure greater freedom for the movement of goods, people, services and capital in Canada and we want to tell him that we support this effort to ensure that Canada is really a common market and that the Liberal Party of Canada will always fully support his efforts to convince the provincial representatives to accept constitutional changes to strengthen Canada's economic union.
In closing, Madam Speaker, I would like to remind the minister that he is entering the crucial phase of negotiations, as he himself knows. Obviously, unanimity would be the best outcome. Of course a unanimous position of the federal government and all the provinces on a set of proposals would be the best of all worlds, but it certainly will not be easy to achieve or even possible.
I would like to quote an article that appeared on May 30 in La Presse. Journalist Marcel Adam wrote that Meech failed because of the unanimity requirement:
That is why Brian Mulroney promised in February to come up with a plan that all provinces would support.
""I do not want nine tenths of an agreement,"" he emphasized. ""I do not want two thirds of an agreement; I want all provinces to sign-""
That is what the Prime Minister of Canada said.
Mr. Adam continued:
Believe me, that statement was heard by all the premiers, who will make a point of reminding him of it when the time comes.
Mr. Adam concluded his article by saying:
If my analysis is correct, the present process will fail for the same reason as Meech: the sacrosanct principle of unanimity.
I think it is very important that we understand why the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada suggested quite a while ago that we had a national referendum to make sure we are not dragged down by provincial Premiers who in their talks and discussions with the Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs and the Prime Minister of Canada will always try to get more. They will
want this or object to that on the basis that it might not be popular in their province.
But at the present time the Canadian interest is paramount. If we can satisfy the legitimate demands of Quebec, the demands of native peoples, and the demands regarding an effective, equitable and elected Senate, I say to the Minister: ""In the end, if you are unable to get unanimity, trust the population of Canada, organize your referendum and you will win it"".

I am pleased from what I have found out about the negotiations to note the state of play to date in terms of what is being tentatively agreed upon. As the minister said there is no agreement until the final negotiations are completed, but the state of play to date reflects a


great deal of what we agreed in this House on the Beaudoin-Dobbie report.
I am very pleased with that because as the minister said to have an inclusive Canada round we must have an inclusive process. Let us turn to what the three parties did in terms of the Beaudoin-Dobbie committee. We had public hearings. We had six national conferences. We involved Canadians in these mini-constituent assemblies across this country. We had long and hard negotiations between the parties. We put aside our political labels. We stood up for Canada and came up with a report that is reflective of what the Canadian people want.
I say today that I am pleased to see that the provinces in the main are listening very carefully to what the Canadian people had to say. I hope later on when the premiers become involved that they too will keep an eye on public opinion and an eye on what the three parties said in the Beaudoin-Dobbie report. I think it is very important.
To date we see in the discussions held across the country some positive news for the aboriginal people of this country. We see an agreement now by all the provinces participating, plus the aboriginal people in the territories, and the federal government, to recognize the inherent right to self-government of aboriginal people. This is long overdue. It is finally going to happen. It is about time in terms of doing justice to our aboriginal people.

As regards the province of Quebec, I think that people everywhere in the country feel that Quebec is different, that it is not at all a province like the others. It is truly a unique and distinct society. Now there is agreement, and that includes Mr. Clyde Wells from Newfoundland, to enshrine the distinct society clause in the Canadian Constitution. There is also a consensus across the country to reform the Supreme Court of Canada in order to amend the Canadian Constitution and allow three civil law judges from Quebec, as well as six common law judges.
It is important for Quebec to protect its unique society, to protect a province which is different and which
Routine Proceedings
constitutes a minority not only in Canada but also in North America.

There has been progressive movement in terms of regional fairness, in terms of regional development and in terms of protecting transfer payments to the provinces from being unilaterally ended by the federal government in the future. There has been progress made in terms of strengthening section 36 of the Constitution, the section on equalization that is so important to six or seven of the provinces including my home province of Saskatchewan.
In terms of the new idea of a social covenant or of an economic union, I am pleased the governments have agreed with a report we made in this House on the details of what should go into a social covenant: the protection of medical care, higher education, primary education, the environment, the right of workers to collective bargaining, and the importance of things like full employment in Canada, decent housing, and a decent standard of living for all Canadians regardless of where they live in this country.
It is the same in terms of minorities and openness: to have some positive changes for minorities, visible and other minorities in Canada-

-and also a change in the Canadian Constitution for linguistic minorities, French speaking and English speaking ones across Canada.

Then we have the Senate. We in the committee probably wrestled more with the Senate issue than any other. I am not surprised the minister is having problems with the Senate issue when he meets with his counterparts across the country.
This is indeed the most important issue, next to perhaps the division of powers, but certainly a very difficult issue to settle in terms of trying to get a compromise and a consensus in the country.
Substantive progress has been made. We now have, for example, agreement all around to have an elected Senate, progress after over a hundred years. We have a very important agreement to have the Senate elected by proportional representation, something that I would not have predicted six or seven months ago would be agreed


Routine Proceedings
to by not only the three national political parties but all the provinces, the aboriginal people and the territories.
With proportional representation we can have a Senate where we can achieve the important goals and objectives of gender parity and representation of minorities, a House that reflects the diversity of this country more than we have today in the House of Commons or indeed in the appointed Senate. Very important progress has been made on the Senate issue.
For the aboriginal people we have agreement now to have aboriginal representation in the Senate. Even three months ago we did not have that agreement. The three parties said in our report that we would recommend aboriginal representation in the Senate if the aboriginal people agreed. At that time there was no consensus in their community. Now there must be a consensus because the aboriginal people have agreed that they should have aboriginal representation in the Senate, again veiy good progress. There has also been some progress in terms of Senate powers. Again I think it is very important.
Finally, in terms of the substantive matters we have on the table to settle the whole issue of whether or not the Senate should be equal or the Senate should be equitable. Tied into that is the amending formula in terms of how we should reform the Constitution in the future.
In terms of the amending formula we have a couple of new ideas on the table. One was proposed by Saskatchewan which would give Quebec and Ontario, the big provinces, and a combination of smaller provinces a veto namely seven provinces representing 85 per cent of the population. This is something we did not have that is worth considering.
We have another idea that is new for the Northwest Territories. Again it is worth considering in terms of the amending formula.
The important matter that will have to be resolved- and this is why I am glad there is a pause this week where people can go back and reflect-is whether the Senate should be equal or equitable.
In the House we have given some pretty clear directions to the minister that we believe the model should be one of greater equity between the provinces.
We have notionally the idea that we have five regions in the country, each with around 20 per cent of the
senators. That would give the small provinces a lot more representation and a lot more clout compared to what they have now. That is the important issue. When we talk about whether it is equitable or equal in the Senate it leads directly to the powers of the Senate. Those two things have to be worked out over the few weeks that lie ahead.
There are one or two other things I want to say. I would like to say to Robert Bourassa, the premier of Quebec, that the rest of Canada has shown its good will. The rest of Canada has gone a considerable distance. The rest of Canada has made some very substantive progress. The time has come very soon when the premier of Quebec should come back to the bargaining table and have some input on behalf of the people of his province.

Madam Speaker, I know that it was difficult following the failure of Meech Lake. However, I also think that the rest of the country is now acting in good faith. We feel that we have the necessary flexibility to make arrangements, not only for Quebecers but also for the aboriginal peoples, the rest of the country, the smaller provinces, and everybody because this is truly a Canada Round.
Given this good faith, it is time for Mr. Bourassa to act. It is time to go back to the negotiation table to represent the population of Quebec. Now is the time to act.

In conclusion, we have a great country. Canadian people are now saying to those of us who are politicians that the time has come to negotiate the deal. The time has come to make the accommodation. The time has come to make the arrangement and to settle the constitutional issue in the next few weeks and put this issue behind us so that in a few months' time we can get back to dealing with the real issues which are issues of hunger, employment, jobs and the recession, real issues that real people face.

I did not make good speeches, Madam Speaker, but I spoke just the same.
It is clear that this party, the Bloc Quebecois, is out to destroy this country as it is today, to divide it. The referendum proposed under this bill runs contrary to


Government Orders
their aims because the bill will allow all Canadians to vote on a question concerning the Constitution.

For that reason, Madam Speaker, these members have sought to deprive Canadians across this country of their right to vote and they are prepared to block this bill in order to do it.
Their votes will not block it. They know that because the government has a big majority and some support elsewhere, but they feel that they can obstruct it in this House. What we saw yesterday was a parade of speakers designed to bring this bill to a standstill in the House. It has prevented our members from getting on with debates on the motions that we would like to debate.
You only have to look at the debate that went on yesterday on the first clause because it was on the title of the bill, for heaven's sake, and everybody had something to say on the title. When does that ever happen? Never. It is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.
What we want to do now is participate in this debate today so that we can put our views on the record with respect to these amendments and this bill and we are going to be deprived of much opportunity because the government, in order to deal with the obstruction, has had to bring in this guillotine and apply time allocation again.
I will come back to that in a moment because I would like to talk about the role of the New Democratic Party in all this. Its members were willing participants. Last night they obstructed this House in allowing us to sit late so that members could continue to speak to these amendments and allow the various amendments at report stage to be debated.

What the New Democratic Party did was say it will not sit late. Its members all stood up and objected when the question was put last night to continue the hours of sitting.
Why did they do that? Because they are not democratic. Remember the Federal Democratic Republic in
Germany, the FDR? Remember that? Why was it called a democratic republic when it was a communist dictatorship? Because it was trying to cover up its anti-democratic values, that is why. It was trying to pretend it was something it was not.
The New Democratic Party is involved in the same exercise. Those members do not want the people of Canada to have a vote on this issue. They do not want Canadians to express their views in a referendum. They want to tell Canadians what is good for them and jam it down their throats.
We in the Liberal Party do not take that view. I am sorry to make this partisan but we are being deprived of our rights to address this bill in this House because of the tactics, the partisan tactics, of the other parties in this House.
We have played easy and co-operative on this and the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader knows that. We worked with him in the committee to get the amendments to this bill. We have agreed to some amendments. We would like more, and we have moved more here that we would like to debate today, but we are going to be deprived of that opportunity because of the government's guillotine and the Bloc's obstruction and the unwillingness of the New Democratic Party to debate late last night.
That is what is depriving us of an opportunity to carry on a reasonable debate on this bill.
We have fault down on one side. We have fault down on another side. Now let us look at the government's hand in all this.
Here we have a government saying it wants to save the country. What a sudden revelation that was to this group because if the government is intending to save the country it would have brought this bill in months and months ago when the Leader of the Opposition stood in this House and asked it to do it. He had a deal with the government House leader to bring this bill in months ago and the government House leader dilly-dallied.
The Quebec caucus on the other side went to the minister of constitutional affairs and got it stopped. That is why this bill was not dealt with months and months ago. Instead the government House leader in his usual dictatorial and bully-boy fashion came waltzing into this House one day and said: ""Here is the bill. Pass it"".


Government Orders
Here we are debating this bill today, three days of debate on second reading, jammed into committee, three sitting days in the committee with closure threatened on the Thursday night so we walked out.
The parliamentary secretary to the government House leader moved a closure motion in committee, for heaven's sake. We walked out but got the committee going again Wednesday because of co-operation on our part and a willingness to get on with the job and do it properly.
It was all done on Tuesday which was faster than the government expected anyway because we were so co-operative. We allowed votes. We carried on. We lost a lot of votes but we carried on and we got the job done.
Now we are back here and we are going to have two days of debate on report stage with 65 amendments and one day of debate at third reading. This on a bill to save the country.
You would think the government would allow this House to have a reasonable debate on this issue. Instead it clamps down at every turn. The Bloc in its hypocritical way is nodding ""yes, yes"" and its members are the ones who caused this particular move on the part of the government.
I can sympathize at least with the bully-boy tactics of the government when I look at what went on in this House yesterday. I can sympathize. I do not agree. I think it is wicked and I think the government should be ashamed of itself for putting itself in this place, but had it brought this bill in before, had it brought it in in a timely way, it would not be in this jam today.
It is its own fault. It was promised in the throne speech a year ago, April as I recall was the date of that throne speech. Here it is a year later and the government is finally bringing the thing in and in its usual bully-boy way is saying, ""Pass the bill now, or else"".
That is what the country is faced with. That is this government's notion of saving Canada. That is its notion of preserving national unity and doing all it can to save the country.
For the government House leader to tiy to bully us the way he has the last two weeks is an example the most shocking abuse.
He is trying to blame the Liberals, who have co-operated throughout on this bill, with everything that has gone wrong. They are trying to blame the Liberal Party of Canada for failing to co-operate when this party has, in fact, co-operated significantly on this bill. We have suggested sensible amendments and we have other sensible amendments that are being rejected. We will accept that and we are willing to have a fairly limited debate and have a vote. We indicated our willingness to do all that.
However, the government House leader is trying to suggest that it is our fault that the country is in this mess when we urged the government six, eight, ten months ago to bring this bill in and get on with it.
I cannot understand the approach of the government House leader. Unfortunately, he has been a real bully-boy throughout this exercise. It is shocking.

I believe it is ten minutes at this stage.
I want to compliment the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands on most of what he said. I was very interested in what he said and I am glad he finally said it. Madam Speaker, you have been in the chair for a good part of the day, the majority of the day. I have been sitting here in the House for the days it has gone on. I got from the table and from the committee clerk the time involved in Bill C-81 in terms of second reading
16.5	hours, about two and a half days. Second reading was two and a half days. Here we are with allocation of time so that at 7.30 p.m. tonight the bells will start to ring for 15 minutes and then we vote on a multitude of amendments. The 64 have been consolidated in either 40 or 23, depending on who you speak to.
The thing is passing strange. We are debating the referendum bill on the Constitution of Canada. We had a statement from the Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs this afternoon, thank goodness, and the loyal opposition spokesperson and the NDP spokesperson. They, at least, were elevating the debate in terms of their participation.
As an independent member who used to belong in the government party, I had the fundamental problem on the Constitution with the government party. We are debating the referendum bill that is giving the government, correctly, a vehicle or a tool to put many serious questions to the Canadian people and take it out of the hands of the leaders of the land who have not been able to define the consensus and I do not think they are going to be able to define the consensus.
I watched Premier Bourassa last night on television pretending that the Senate problem was going to keep him away from the bargaining table. I have partial sympathy for that chameleon of political science, the premier of Quebec. I can sympathize that he may not want to get involved in the federal-provincial negotiations now with some of the apparent agreements in principle with no legal text. Therefore, blame it on the Senate. Who wants the Senate-an appointed body that is an anachronism of history and has no place in a democratic elected system?
This may be the hang-up people are pretending it is. Frankly, for Premier Bourassa it is one of the double ironies in the world. He stayed away from the bargaining. I can understand his post-Meech hangover, or post-Meech depression. There was a depression across the country because things had been whipped up in the country, whipped up with a lot of intellectual dishonesty that never should have happened. It was one of the problems I had to face and I finally walked.
Having had the problems, having had the initial backing off and understanding in part-I am very open on this, but I am also a very practical politician-I can see politicians in several parties and/or perhaps the premier of Quebec using the dead Senate issue. I say the Senate is dead until it gets some credibility and if you are going to have it, it has to be elected, I agree with that.
Then we get into all the processes, all the definitions of what we give it, power, and how do you have it elected, and is it equal, is it equitable, and/or regional.
Let us go back to the beginning. Let us eliminate the Senate and give the people a chance to vote as to whether they even want a Senate. The NDP used to be a party proud of at least standing for some principle in reform and it was abolition of the Senate. I do not agree with the objectives of my colleagues the Parti Quebegois but I do give them credit. I am totally against what they want but at least they speak with some conviction on what they want.
We have been in this debate and I agree it has been shortened. I understand the government's problem, but frankly, all members, without obstruction, should have a chance to speak on this issue which is fundamental to the core of the nation. Here we are with an allocation order that is going to terminate tonight and then a third reading tomorrow and we have not had a leader of the three national parties speak in this debate.
With the greatest respect for the House of Commons, jiaving been here longer than most members in the House, this is a terrible insult to the whole history and tradition.


John Diefenbaker would be rolling over in his grave to know we are going to discuss the potential referendum to try and resolve impasse on constitutional discussions. We have not had a national leader participate in this debate. We have had two allocation orders already, one on second reading and now one on report stage.
There are fundamental things. I have listened to the hon. minister for intergovernmental affairs this afternoon and I give him credit. He has brought civility, calm, and patience, patience that frankly is starting to be a yoke around his neck in these delicate discussions as they have had them from coast to coast for months.
We all know the reality and there is now an impasse there and some are blaming it on the Senate, some are blaming it on something else. It is easy to blame the Senate.
Even the NDP spokesman yesterday talked about the mechanics of a bill. All we are talking about is mechanics. Shall it be money here, or committees there, or registered agents there, time allocation here? There has been no discussion at all from of the three national parties as to what they want in terms of a future in this country that a referendum may help to find.
As I say, that is corroborated by the absence of the three national leaders unless they intervene in this debate sometime between now and 7.30 p.m. and I think they dam well should.
They should tell Canadians. We know what the Parti Quebegois stands for. As I say, I am totally against what it stands for but I can understand it to a point. Frankly, unless we become more realistic, compatible, and tolerant, as the hon. minister of intergovernmental affairs said today, we are going to have problems.
It did not help things today not to give the Parti Quebecois a chance to give its view, which we know. You know what is going to happen with the Bloc Quebecois. You know what is going to happen in the Quebec papers tomorrow. Its members are going to be martyrs. They have been cut off at the pass. They could not speak.
Here you are going to have the minister of intergovernmental affairs speak. You could have the spokesperson who happens to be from Quebec, the member for
Government Orders
Papineau speak. You had the member from the NDP speak.
They could speak on something that is fundamental and that we all call the Canada round. What do we do? We shut out those who are dedicated to a Quebec, admittedly by itself. They are in this House but we cut them off at the pass. Wait until we see in the Quebec papers how they become pseudo-martyrs.
Tonight we are going to go through the hocus-pocus and hypocrisy in many ways of voting on 30, 40 or 50 amendments when we usually have agreement. I can understand their interest from a straight political point of view. They have been very definite in their interest and we are going to be here for hours.
That will be a nice story, not you or I, not to the political elite that have been trying to get a consensus, and other political elites that have been trying to break up the country, but to the average Quebecois or the average Canadian. Speaking of the Quebecois, they are going to say: ""Hey, our boys did not have a chance. Those dirty anglophones across the country cut them off at the pass"". We did that today.
There are so many things to say. I do not know how many minutes I have left.
I want to come back to the minister of intergovernmental affairs because there are so many things one could say and perhaps I may have a chance later on or at third reading. I agree with the majority of what the government House leader said. I really want to put this out in the public domain and I hope that someone from the government side answers it. Yesterday, we saw a set-up question from the member for Fredericton- York-Sunbury to the minister of Indian affairs about Indian self-government.
I want someone from the government side, either the Minister of Justice who certainly knows about it, the minister of Indian affairs and certainly the minister of intergovernmental affairs to try and get through. What happened to Meech? People thought we were actually dishonest. We cannot let the same intellectual dishonesty that affected Meech affect the very sensitive progress now. One of the most sensitive things is the whole question of the inherent right of the aboriginals to


Government Orders
self-government. The minister today said this is not new. I take great exception to that. Then there is the proviso in the constitutional discussions that we are not going to talk about this or adjudicate it for three years.
What I want is for someone on the government side to answer before this debate is completed how to rationalize this potential agreement which is sensitive and which is properly receiving veiy considered response across the country.
There is a court of appeal decision in British Columbia between Delgamuukw, who is the plaintiff, also known as Earl Muldoe, suing on his own behalf and on behalf of all the members of the Houses of Delgamuukw and Haaxw, et al, against Her Majesty the Queen in right of the province of British Columbia and the Attorney General of Canada.
In conclusion my point is this. This case which is presently before the courts is on the very issue of the inherent right of the aboriginals to self-government. How can we have ministers of the Crown say in this House or ministers at the negotiating table pretend that there is going to be a three-year moratorium on defining this issue?

I greatly admired his democratic approach to us and his recognition of the reaction that the French press and French-speaking Quebecers will surely have to our being gagged by this government for wanting to express a different point of view. It is using laws or regulations to limit such a serious debate to a single day. For two years, since the Meech Lake Accord failed, this government has been telling us that it wants to save this country. It wants to come up with an acceptable proposal for Quebec. Two years later, we are still going around in circles, no further ahead but pushing forward, not to save the country but to save the face of this government and its leader. They are trying to rush through a bill without examining some 60-odd amendments that have been proposed. We are now at the second set of amendments and already debate is being cut off. That is unacceptable in a democracy.
The Prime Minister, the leader of the government, has been going around the world for two years at public expense and I would have thought that he would bring back the great democratic virtues of other governments, but no, he has only brought back manners. Is he following the example of the government of South Africa or Iran or some African dictatorship? He has brought back a new way of using our parliamentary system-

You know other Conservative members sat in this House, and I found out what they said. You will recall that the Liberal government in 1979, before it was defeated, also proposed a Canada-wide referendum. A slew of people in Quebec and in this House rose against it. Let us remember the Secretary of State for External Affairs. Let us also remember that there were not many Conservative members from Quebec then, but there was one very well-known and highly respected member from Joliette, Mr. LaSalle, if I may name him.

Members from Quebec, in particular the Minister of Communications (Mrs. Sauve), urged members of the House to support the government in its endeavour to acquire this repressive too! because she felt the danger which is upon us. I was sorry to see her lack of trust in the decision that Quebeckers will be making, and I think that she has acknowledged her party's failure to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of a province and meet the objectives of a majority of Quebeckers as well as all Canadians, who would want to see, in this constitutional reform, a chance to secure an interesting future for all concerned.
He condemned it, he got up, he spoke, he defended Quebec's higher interests. The hon. member for Joliette added:
- the federal government [the Liberal government of that time] considers it essential to pass a law to oppose a possible decision by a majority of Quebeckers.
History is repeating itself. Why a referendum? To interfere with the democratic process embarked upon following the failure of Meech, with the Belanger-Cam-peau Commission and Bill 150 which will give us a referendum on the real issue: do you want Quebec to be a sovereign state or not?
With its Canada-wide referendum, this government, a government incapable of tabling proposals, incapable of carrying out its duty, incapable of uniting its federalist forces, incapable of making offers, will interfere with that process, as democratic and fair as it is, and with the reflection undertaken by the people of Quebec which will lead to a referendum to be held in the fall.
They are afraid. And not only are they putting forward an act providing for a Canada-wide referendum, but this act is totally devoid of the democratic virtues and the respect for citizens that one would expect from any referendum act, as is the case all over the world. As the hon. House leader said, they are going to try and buy votes by spending millions on publicity. It has already started, with the Canada 125 advertisements we are seeing on the tube, often using very debatable statements such as Canada presumably being number one, very debatable statements indeed. Millions would also be spent during the limitless referendum. Can you imagine a less moral, less acceptable act of democracy than dipping into the public purse-what am I saying?-rath-

All that money squandered. Such an immoral act is unheard of in the western world.
Today, instead of debating the amendments put forward to limit expenditures-and this happens to be one of them-they will not even take part in the debate. So much for democracy! How undemocratic! What sort of democracy has this country become? It had a great track record as far as following the British parliamentary system was concerned.
We are turning our backs on our entire democratic history by spending millions in an attempt to buy public support. Why not have a yes umbrella and a no umbrella like they had in England for the referendum on whether or not they should join the Common Market and in Quebec as well?
What would we have called Quebec if there had not been a yes umbrella and a no umbrella in the 1980 referendum, if it had failed to provide a start-up grant to both and had spent money through its 39 ministries to convince the public to vote ""yes""? We would have called Quebec undemocratic. We would have called it fascist. We would have compared it to the government of South Africa.
But that was not the case. Quebec did respect the principles and the values of democracy. If the Canadian charter prevents you from limiting expenditures, tear it up. It is no good. A charter that does not allow you to prevent millions from being spent in a limitless referendum is no good and should be amended. In closing, Madam Speaker, I condemn both the limit put on this debate and this horrible waste of money to have a referendum which will solve nothing as the hon. member for Joliette said in 1979.

Whether they are a member of the committee or not they have always had the right and that continues today. It is part of the tradition of the place. It is part of the tradition of democracy.
Those members who were present on Monday at committee hearings heard testimony from a number of people, including the royal commission report on electoral reform and a law professor that the opposition had picked. I want to say to the Liberal deputy House leader that every witness asked for by anybody was heard by that committee. No witness was refused.
The testimony was rather clear and consistent that under the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms the democratic rights are not even subjected to the notwithstanding clause. Those democratic rights are rights which no government can override at any time in any way, whether it be provincial or federal; that is the right to vote, the right to hold office and the right to those kinds of administrative practices that enable you to activate that right. I suggest to the House that includes the notion that you must be able to associate with others to exercise those rights and influence people's votes. I suggest to the member who is moving this particular package of amendments, this is the kind of logic and the kind of practice that comes out of our history that has been around for a long time in this country, but is codified in the Constitution through the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Any attempt by the Government of Canada to restrict the rights of people to associate for the purposes of influencing the outcome of a vote would, in fact, be arguable clearly before a court of law and, based on the testimony we heard in committee, would likely lead to


Government Orders
the striking down of those parts of a piece of legislation that attempted to do that.
I would say on that basis where we are fighting for the future of our country, one we hope will be better for our children and our children's children, that we should have as wide open a system as possible to enable people to participate. We should have a referendum wherein people are allowed to participate in unfettered ways, which respect not only the wording of our Constitution but the intent of our Constitution, to activate and maximize those democratic rights that lie at the heart of the entire system of government.
There can be a case made for recognizing associations and the bill attempts to do that. That was the purpose of some of the amendments, to say: ""If you want to associate, if you want to spend beyond a certain amount and under another certain amount, associate, register, let us know who you are, where your money is coming from and how you are spending it"". That is part of the bill.
However, to say to people: ""There are only two groups you can belong to, that some unknown group with an unknown membership is going to be able to tell you whether or not you can participate the way you want in arguing for the future of your country"" is to state the kind of principle I would hope this democratically elected institution would not uphold. If we were to make a mistake and uphold it at this point, I am sure that the courts of our land would strike it down as being an infringement that runs counter to the activation and the actualization of the democratic rights and the other rights in the Charter that deal with freedom of association and freedom of speech.
I simply wanted to make that point. I am sorry I was distracted by the rabbit tracks of how hard people were willing to work on behalf of their country. I would like to assure the nation that the members on this side of the House are always willing to be pleasant and work hard, whether they do it in their riding or in the House. They do it in some kind of balanced picture. I am in a position to know because of my position within the party. I doubt if there has ever been a harder working group of parliamentarians who participate more in the major decisions than exists in our party at this moment in history.
It has been a wide-open process from start to finish with a lot of information and a lot of chances to discuss
and influence and that is the way it should be. Any attempt by the Parliament of Canada to pass a piece of legislation that denies others in this country that opportunity to do likewise is a misguided piece of legislation and I would urge members not to support amendments that take us in that direction.

I am going to quote him. The quote comes from a conference he attended at Alternatives '91 that was held in Banff, Alberta. I quote: ""I have come to the conclusion that in the particular case of a Constitution as distinguished from a mandate for programs arising out of a specific election, I believe we have to have a referendum as ultimate ratification. What I want to impress upon you though, because I am a pragmatist and a westerner, is that it is very important when I think back to the constitutional negotiations of 1981, if you believe in the equality of provinces""-and I think this is the important thing he says-""the referendum has to be by province, not by region and not by simple national majority. We are a confederation"".
This is why I believe the colleagues on my left are right. They are certainly not represented in this forum. They are not being allowed to participate in committees and they were not able to respond today to the minister of intergovernmental affairs.
As the member for Annapolis Valley-Hants said, it is important on a national referendum issue for the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the New Democratic Party and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to be able to express their feelings on the Constitution. They have not done so.
We have a bill before us on referendums. This bill is not a binding referendum. It is simply a polling of people. As has been asked before, why spend $100 million on a referendum that is not binding? It is simply an indication of what people feel at a given moment and it is a very, very expensive poll. We should not proceed with an incomplete bill.
I introduced in the House two referendum bills that would have been binding on the federal government in its own jurisdiction. It should not go beyond the jurisdiction of the federal government because we are a federation of provinces and we have no jurisdiction to deal with


provincial jurisdictions like the province of Alberta, for instance.
Therefore I think the bill before the House does not respond to the needs of the nineties. People today want to have input into what is happening in this country. They are fed up with all this constitutional talk, this poker game that the government is playing with the people of Canada.
As time progresses we have to look seriously at what options we should have. We have a country that is beautiful but we do not negotiate with the partners. If the Bloc Quebecois, for instance, is representative of the province of Quebec, it should have a say in this issue. It should be invited to committees. It should be invited to participate. Otherwise our country is going to fall apart.
The oldest democracies in the world like Switzerland have referendums. Those referendums can be initiated by the electorate and are binding on parliament and on the government. But it has to be a field in the jurisdiction of the federal, provincial or municipal government.
Somebody mentioned that Switzerland was slow in progressing in certain areas, for instance the rights of certain people, but it had the referendum and it passed.
The people have to have the last word in any government. The problem in Canada as I see it today is that we have been governed from above. We have not been governed from the people. Members come to this House and are ruled by old traditional rules of the 19th century where even a member cannot address another member across the floor. He has to address the Chair. It is not like in the Senate, in the other House where a member can talk across to another member. They were the lords. They were the upper crust. In this House we are simply the commoners and a commoner cannot talk to another commoner across the way. He has to address the Chair. This is an old rule, a rule of the 19th century. I am surprised socialist members have not asked for changes to this rule. They seem to like it.

If we want changes, we have to have in the first place a referendum that is binding. Second there should be initiative. It means that people can initiate a referendum on something they disagree with. We should be open, as I said, so that everybody in the House can be represented on a committee. I as an Independent and other members who are Independent are not invited to sit on committees. The Bloc Quebecois has nine members who are not allowed to sit on constitutional committees affecting the province of Quebec.
If I am right, the polls indicate that the Bloc Quebecois probably represents 60 per cent of the voters on the French speaking side of the population. Those voters do not have a voice in this House and I believe it is not just.
If we want to build a country, we have to be able to speak in the House and be able to represent. Then, naturally, there would be no conflicts and we could resolve the constitutional issues.
The province of Alberta has just introduced a bill on binding referenda. I am sure that the premier of Alberta, Mr. Getty, will represent faithfully the feelings of Albertans. One of the reasons he is going to represent them is that he is a firm believer western Canadians have been shafted by the system that exists right now.
If an election is held in Canada, before it reaches the border of Manitoba the cards have been played and we know who is going to be the government. This is why we need an equal and effective Senate. This triple-E Senate is necessary to maintain Confederation. Whether it is Atlantic Canada or whether it is western Canada, it has to have input in central government.
I want to conclude by saying that the bill before us, Bill C-81 which is called a referendum bill, is really not a referendum bill. It is a bill simply to poll people. It is not binding. It will simply indicate the feeling of the people

in the country. This could be accomplished much easier by having a poll done by some company.

I heard one member just moments ago talk about the doubt and the loss of confidence in the parliamentary process. Then we had to sit through an exercise which demonstrated that a great deal of incompetence and a great deal of idiocy occur here and is portrayed on television sets across this land with parliamentarians who purport to be participating in a particular debate but utterly fail to do so, insulting one another on bases that have nothing at all to do with constructive contribution to debate.
It strikes me that we could not have had ludicrousness portrayed more starkly than to enter into debate on whether we call one another by our names or our constituencies. The real issue is whether in fact, as the hon. House leader on the other side indicated, a referendum is a noble exercise in the democratic process.
I would submit there are some instances in which a referendum can be a very appropriate means by which the electorate, the common person, can be involved in a decision-making process. As I have said in this House before, if the electorate is to engage in making decisions then the decisions better be clearly set out in terms of what the decision is all about.
What we have before us is the prospect of some fraction of 25 million people, those old enough to vote, making a decision not on whether we should have alcohol, not on whether we should have conscription or any other similarly simple question, but on the very complex package which the record will indicate not even the day-by-day participants understand very well. If they understand very well the variety of propositions which will be the constitutional package, they certainly have serious doubts about what the implications of all of those propositions might be.
If this referendum is to go forward it is going to be exceedingly important that every person who constitutes the electorate understands clearly what the proposition is, that is they understand what the constitutional proposals will be in a whole number of spheres and who is to be trusted to communicate what those issues are.
The House leader on the other side suggested that the most noble form of the democratic process, the most noble expression of freedom of speech and freedom of association, is to have every little group represented that can get up the money and is able to constitute themselves a committee for the purpose of taking one side or another in this referendum. What he suggested was that no spending limit is the most ideal expression of democratic freedom if we mean by that freedom of association and freedom of speech for the wealthy.
Have no doubt about it. This referendum, whether it is decided in terms of what is right to decide as I see it or wrong to decide as I see it, has a very large probability of being decided in direct proportion to the amount of money available to one side or the other.

If you think we are talking from a vacuum of experience, witness the vast majority of referenda that have occurred in the United States where there are no such spending limits and you will learn the lesson. If that is not a sufficient demonstration of the dangers, many of us had those dangers adequately demonstrated to us in the 1988 election where gold by weight determined the outcome.
We are not talking about a defence of democracy by those spokespersons on the other side, we are talking about a defence of manipulation. We are talking about a defence of the capacity of those who have to lead those who have not down the garden path. Do not mistake the prospect. The electorate of this country will never understand clearly what they are voting for and what they are voting against if there is an election based on the premises being defended by this government.


Is there a solution to it? The hon. House leader on the government side indicated there is a preponderance of legal opinion which indicates that any limitation in the number of committees, the amount of money that might be spent, will be seen as a contravention of the charter. That is not ambiguously so. There still exists a difference of opinion.
I believe the principle is correct that there should be spending limits. I believe there is reason in a limitation of the pro and the con to two committees. I believe that strongly. If that is so, then we have included in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms a principle that all around me I have heard defended when we have pleaded that equality in the charter should be absolute.
We have heard a quick defence of the notwithstanding clause, a defence for no other reason than to ensure inequality. But we have not heard a mention of the application of the notwithstanding clause to ensure that the democratic process as expressed by a referendum would work. I find that strange.
In the absence of a Supreme Court decision that might be gotten by reference or in the absence of an appropriate decision and therefore the application of the notwithstanding clause to ensure fairness, what we will have is not an expression of democracy, but an expression of the power of some to mislead the many and lead them down a garden path. It is not exclusively with respect to the constitutional proposal but in respect to any notion this government or any other might put to a referendum as an excuse for not making the kind of decisions we are elected to make.
I want to emphasize to the people that are watching this debate, look out. Do not be fooled. When that 30-page document comes out which constitutes the constitutional proposal and you are asked to vote yes or no, you had better watch the fine print because this government is like a used car salesman, the fine print is what could kill the country and we had better watch out for that.

I was one of the members of the committee last week when the House was in recess who came back and reviewed the bill in committee. I would like to say a few words about the
Government Orders
element of fairness in this debate that is going on here today. During my 10 minutes, I will probably comment on some of the debate that took place in committee.
I am concerned about the rights of individual Canadians. How does the individual Canadian participate in this referendum, if it ever comes to a referendum? Many will write letters to the editors and many will knock on doors. There are many ways that people can participate indirectly and not spend any money that is recorded.
However, how about an individual who feels strongly about Canada and decides that he or she would like to put a small ad in the local newspaper expressing how he or she feels about Canada. They place one, two or three ads. In many small weeklies across Canada the bill might come to $200.
What is wrong with that? What is wrong with thousands of individual Canadians wanting to participate that way? Yet we have heard through the process that somehow this is wrong, it should not be allowed to take place and that there should be rules that if you want to place an ad maybe you have to go under an umbrella committee.
It is important that individual Canadians would have an opportunity to express his or her view openly and not have to worry about regulations.
The legislation states that if over $5,000 is spent, there should be some transparency. Therefore, I am sure in communities across this nation we will see service clubs deciding they would like to do something as a group of 40 women or 70 men. Any organization can get involved in its own way during this referendum campaign which, if it is required, would be less than five weeks in duration. But if it decides it is going to spend over $5,000, it would then have to register as a referendum committee.
Once an organization registers, a tremendous amount of transparency must take place. It must then indicate if it has had people donating over $250 and then register their names. It must indicate its source of funds. It must then list down its expenses. It must appoint someone to be its financial officer or auditor and it has to have its books audited. This is all controlled by the Chief Electoral Officer. The committee must be registered. There are numerous regulations that have been put in place. There


Government Orders
is a measure of transparency for those who want to spend over $5,000.
Some people have suggested that maybe the limit should be $20,000. I think that is too high. Some have suggested the limits be as low as $1,000. That was one of the amendments put forward in the committee but we thought that was too low because although an ad in The Cambridge Reporter is relatively cheap, for a North York service club to buy a one-page ad in The Toronto Star would cost well over $1,000 and then it would have to report. We do not want to take away from individual Canadians the opportunity to participate in their own way. If they get over $5,000, again there are very tight restrictions as far as the reporting goes. We do not think that is taking away a person's freedom to express themselves, their freedom of speech, their freedom of association. All it does is provide a measure of transparency.
In the committee some people suggested that if you are going to spend over $5,000 then you need to have 100 members in your committee. Again, you look at some service clubs that have 40 members in rural Canada operating under a charter for some 30 to 40 years suddenly having to go out and sign up extra people just so that they can be a referendum committee. The government members rightly voted that amendment down. It is common to have service clubs with under 100 members. We thought that would put undue restrictions on them.
Another concern was that some members opposite thought that we should make public funding available. I think constituents have to understand that during an election when one contributes to my campaign or if they contribute $100 to any federal member's campaign, they get a $75 tax credit on their income tax return. In the plebiscite or referendum campaign, if an individual contributes $100, there is no tax credit. There is no public funding involved that way. Because there are no taxpayers' dollars going back, then indeed there should be greater freedom for the individual as to how they want to participate in the referendum.
One of the things that we really want to try to do with this is a precautionary measure. Right now the provinces, the federal government, the territories and other groups are sitting down and are getting close to, hopefully, a successful conclusion. If they reach that successful conclusion, there will be no need for this. Even if seven provinces with greater than 50 per cent of the population or even if there was total unanimity and everybody signed, one of the amendments from the opposition party said that we will go on with this referendum in any event. It is a non-binding referendum. It is non-binding because of the way the Canadian Constitution is written. Even if everybody signed and the Parliament of Canada, the Senate of Canada and all the provincial parliaments went through their procedure, the Liberal member thought we should have this non-binding referendum in any event.
I pointed out to him that the cost of doing a referendum is serious business. The cost is well over $100 million. The government member said: ""If we have an agreement and if everyone has agreed with it, why would we want to go on afterward and have a $100 million poll for no purpose at all?"" That is an amendment that was defeated.
I would like to sum up by saying that there are many elements in this plebiscite legislation. I think it is important that we not take away the right of individual Canadians in their small way for small expenses to express their view on how they feel about Canada. There are people who would put a $1,000 ad into a newspaper and state their view. That would have a marginal impact. But if some like a Darryl Sittler or Jean Beliveau puts an ad in the paper that also costs $1,000, that probably carries a lot more influence.
We struggle with the people who are talking about spending controls. How do you try and put a value on two different ads, one from an ordinary Canadian and one from a Canadian who has a high profile?
I see that my time is expiring and I want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on this bill.

3911736,ca.proc.d.1992-06-03.4.3.1.76,1992-06-03,865481e2-e37f-4e94-9ed4-c78ac3eeea08,ca.m.5931,Mr. Phillip Edmonston (Chambly):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,REFERENDUM ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and humility that I come before this House to speak on this bill because Bill C-81 is a very important bill.
I am speaking on behalf of my party, but particularly as a member from Quebec who sat on the Beaudoin-Dob-bie committee for over seven months listening to people's views on referendums and listening to Canadians from coast to coast to coast telling us what they felt was


needed to get out of this constitutional morass we find ourselves in.
In general, I think referenda are a good idea. I am in favour of referenda. I believe in the city of Montreal, for example, that people should be particularly consulted before they are forced to accept these huge tax increases or forced to accept these mega projects, whether it be an Olympic stadium or whether it be any other huge expense. People should be questioned when the situation is one of a yes or no and where there is a process which is fair.
This is not a fair process. Bill C-81 is not a fair law. This law is bad. A bad law is a bad law is a bad law. I do not know when this debate became some sort of morality play where, if you are against this bad law, you are against Canada. How ridiculous can it be?
I heard that patriotism was the last refuge of scoundrels but I never knew that it would be the refuge of Liberals and Conservatives, but it seems to be. We have transformed what I thought would be a legitimate debate on a legitimate law. It is a legitimate law. It is a law which is being passed by a legitimately formed House. All of a sudden we have drawn this line in the sand that if you are against this particular referendum, you are an enemy of Canada, you are an enemy of the Prime Minister and an enemy of the people. No, my gosh, that is not the case at all.
We believe this is bad law. We believe that people should be consulted in a fair and honest manner. When it is said that this is not fair, if I was a lawyer before any judge and I consider members here my judges collectively, you would have to make the case why it is unfair.
We had a number of committees saying there must be a double majority. There must be a protection for certain groups in Canada in order to make sure that this referendum is fair. I can talk about Beaudoin-Edwards, which is where that recommendation was. I can talk about Beaudoin-Dobbie and their recommendation or I can go back 10 years and talk about Pepin-Robarts, with the same recommendations.
I intend to vote against the referendum bill. I intend to vote against it for several reasons. First is its unfairness. Second, we are talking about $108 million-not thou-
Govemment Orders
sands-$108 million super survey that may or may not take place, that may take place in every province but Quebec. That is interesting. That means Quebecers are second class citizens and that they may not get to vote. Or it may take place in every province but British Columbia because perhaps they are going to have their own referendum. It may not take place in Alberta because Alberta will be having its own referendum.
It is not a referendum in a traditional sense.
It is not saying: ""Look, we believe in you, the people. We are going to trust you. We are going to follow you. You just simply tell us what your opinion is, and we will put it into law"". No. It is a non-binding referendum. In other words, it is a referendum which is saying: ""Tell us what you think. What we are going to do is make our own law anyhow. We will not guarantee to you that you going into that voting booth is what we are going to do"".
What kind of signal does this send to the public, that we really care about their opinion? If this government cared about the opinion of the public, of Canadians, it would have put the GST to a referendum. I would love to have seen it do that. It would have put the free trade to a referendum. I would love to have seen it do that, but it did not.
Let us not be foolish. This government does not trust the people. It does not care about the people. This government just wants to manipulate for $108 million some sort of a rinky-dink kind of referendum that it may not or may have in certain parts of the country.
This is a recipe for disaster. This is not for friends of Canada or enemies of Canada. This is a recipe for disaster. It is surprising for a government which has, I think, made some good progress on the constitutional front with the different committees that have held hearings before. It has done fairly well.
The first ministers right now are just about getting together on some more delicate points. I am saying: Let them do their job. That is what they were elected to do.
I do not see how a referendum could possibly do anything but provoke Clyde Wells, the premier of Newfoundland. Are we going to tell Clyde Wells: ""We do not trust you. We are just going to hold this over your head so if your people vote maybe 51 per cent against, you are

Government Orders
going to follow their view"". He is not going to do that. That man is not going to be moved by a non-binding poll.
This shows how bankrupt this government is for ideas. I think I have wakened a few of my colleagues on the other side. I am glad for that. The point is if you are dealing with a federal system you do not go trying to hammerlock the premiers into agreeing with you.
You do not do that. You do not threaten them when there is no reason to threaten them, when progress is being made. You surely do not come out with some half-I was going to use an unparliamentary word-donkey, there you go-half donkey kind of referendum which is only going to divide people, which is only going to be ridiculous because it will be so confusing. Finally, it will cost $108 million for very little.
In conclusion, I would just like to say that we have to trust the people. We have to believe in the people. We have to do what we were elected to do. We should be leaders. We should be leaders who say: This is what we can do for the constitutional problems that we have caused.
If we can get together here in this House and put all this stupid partisanship aside and say: ""Look, this is what we need"", we could do it.
There has been progress with all the three leaders here and other leaders as well who have said that we believe that Canada is much more important than these political games, this referendum here and referendum there because finally, it is not going to be a referendum which is going to solve our problems.
It is not going to be millions upon millions of dollars spent on polling which we have never seen the results of from this government. That is not going to solve our problems, and it is not going to be us constantly making on the government side these TV commercials showing what a great place Canada is.
Of course it is a great place, but we are not responding to the real problems which are constitutional in nature.
I just simply say, let us quit zig-zagging around here. Let us go to the heart of the problem and make sure that the elected officials do their jobs and that we do not waste any more taxpayers' money. I was not elected here to waste money, not to spend $100 million.

I will not review in detail the amendments proposed by our colleague from Jonquiere. He undoubtedly put a lot of thought into them and structured them in such a way that they are interesting and can be easily analysed. But our colleague from Edmonton South West raised the issue of the proposed amendments and I believe-as a matter of fact, I am certain of it-he studied-and analysed the consequences of those amendments. During the remarks he made yesterday, he was able to put the whole debate in context.
We are dealing with the very fibre of the Canadian nation. This debate is not solely a parliamentary debate, it is also a debate which makes the members of this House spokespersons.

But, there are in this House members, particularly from the Bloc Quebecois, who make sophisms. Finally, those sophisms become dangerous. On the surface, they appear interesting, but when you dissect them, you fully realize that they are dangerous for society as a whole, not only in Quebec, but across Canada.
They talk about freedom, about gagging, about a lack of democracy, and they revel in a number of notions and concepts. They want yes-and-no committees in order to guarantee freedom. Freedom, Mr. Speaker, is not necessarily in controlling. Canadians are able to make their own opinion, their own judgment, their own evaluation, and it is not relying very much on the national conscience, on the conscience of Canadian citizens in each province to think that, if there were umbrella commit-


tees, if the data were too rigid, we could, as much as for spending limits, make sure that issues would appear.
This is a false debate. A fundamental question must be answered here. Do we belong to a country? Do we want to break that country? Canadian citizens, both from Quebec and from the other provinces, are adult enough, smart enough and confident enough of their views and of their sense of belonging to be able to answer a question if a referendum was necessary.
Too much interference seems to be the real danger here. If we start setting all kind of standards, we start interfering with people's basic human values. This debate demands a renewed awareness of where we come from, of our family values and our roots. The umbrella principle as applied to the yes and no sides is so restrictive that it would prevent individuals from making use of their individual freedoms and the freedoms of the groups to which they belong.
In Quebec, in the present as in the past, a great deal has been said about the evils of money. Parti Quebecois members repeat ad nauseam that money leads to the destruction of our moral fibre. I maintain that money is not necessarily associated with negative or evil behaviour. A person can be wealthy and at the same time be capable of doing good, while people with less money do not necessarily have a monopoly on virtue. I think this insistence upon restrictions, and at this point I want to get back to my remarks on sophisms, this sometimes cavalier tendency to associate money and evil is unacceptable. In fact, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean was a case in point yesterday.

When a cause is just, people can always make themselves heard, and I repeat that anyone who thinks that Canadian citizens and Quebec francophones will let

themselves be bought underestimates the intelligence, feelings and moral fibre of the people of this country. It is insulting, and that is why I am grateful for this opportunity to rise in the House and reject this connection out of hand. My family has been in Quebec, in Canada, in our country, for 12 generations. This is an insult to the integrity of a French Canadian, an insult to the integrity of a Canadian or a Quebecer, period.
I sat with our colleague from Papineau-Saint-Michel on the Belanger-Campeau commission, and we all know what happened there. While the commission was sitting, there were people who were working very hard to advance a cause. However, aside from these efforts to identify certain objectives and implement them, there were also discussions taking place behind closed doors. There was a lot going on in secret. One of the vice-presidents, who ostensibly did not take sides, had already taken a position. Another vice-president is now using all kinds of money to tiy and get a movement going. Apparently what is sauce for the goose is not necessarily sauce for the gander.
Before I finish, I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak in this House in my mother tongue, to do so with pride and to tell those on the other side of the House who are trying to sabotage our efforts that since I came to Ottawa, I have had both the privilege and the opportunity to speak French and to be just as good a Canadian as anyone else in this country.
You see how bad tempered and vituperative they get when we start talking about human values, Mr. Speaker?

For the moment, I will keep talking about those umbrella committees for the yes and the no sides that the member claims to want to integrate to the bill by way of his motions. He now asks that these umbrella committees for the yes and the no sides now be included in the act in order to help limit expenses.
As the bill stands now, there could be any number of committees in any given riding, throughout Canada. The government says that it will put a ceiling on expenses, that a maximum of 56 cents per voter will be allowed; yet, the number of referendum committees is unlimited.
Based on my understanding of this bill, a resident of British Columbia could very well register in my constituency-why not?-since there is nothing against it in the present legislation.

It may be the limit for the expenses incurred by the Conservatives, but for people like us who are used to democracy, this is not what we call limiting expenses.
What I find praiseworthy are the efforts made by the member for Jonquiere when he decides to propose amendments to the referendum bill, in particular his Motion No. 35, at paragraphs (d) and (e). I would like to quote these provisions because I think it is important to emphasize this point. I know you have read these motions yesterday, but I must confess it was a bit fast for me to understand. This is why I am going to read them a bit more slowly, so we can better grasp the meaning of Motion No. 35, more particularly paragraph (d).
It is to prescribe, for each province, the maximum amount of referendum expenses that may be incurred by either referendum committee, that is the one supporting the referendum question or the one opposing it.
Paragraph (e) prescribes the maximum amount of referendum expenses that may be incurred by either referendum committee throughout Canada or in two or


more provinces specified in the proclamation issued under subsection 3(1).
As I said earlier, this is wishful thinking on the part of the hon. member for Jonquiere, he knows that his government will never agree to put a ceiling on spending.
It is obvious when one sees the orgy of spending which is being done for Canada's 125th birthday on the back of Quebecers and with our money. Every night on television we have to endure commercials on the 125th birthday. We are certainly justified in wondering what the government will spend next on the referendum.
I do not see in the amendments proposed by the hon. member for Jonquiere-as I said, I read them quite quickly, since the leader of the government introduced time allocation-anything which would force the government to register with one of the committees. This is not in and it seems rather important to me. If he had wanted amendments that mattered he would have provided for the government to be included in one of the referendum committees.
In other words, the Conservative government can waste public money any way it wishes. The bill does not set any limit on spending by the federal government so I would have expected the hon. member for Jonquiere to include limits in his amendments and motions.
As we can see Quebec conservative members will not be supporting the motions of their colleague from Jonquiere. Apparently he did not manage to convince them to join him, which is regrettable.

Government Orders
Finally, I would like to mention another point where the proposals are lacking. In his motion No. 35 the hon. member for Jonquiere proposes that the Governor in Council may make regulations governing referendum committees. I would have preferred that they be governed by the statute.
I have one minute left? Then, Mr. Speaker, during that minute I would like to talk about the French language that the hon. member for Outremont was mentioning a short while ago. The French language does fare too well in these motions. On page XXVI of the Order Paper for June 2 alone I could pick four mistakes. In the third paragraph at the third line you can read ""-d'une provinces-"", with an s at the end. At the last line of that same paragraph we read: ""une amende maximale de cinquanate mille dollars"". It should probably read ""cinquante mille"", but it is one more mistake. There is another one in the penultimate paragraph where it says: ""Le comite referendaire qui contravient-"", instead of ""contrevient"". And in the last paragraph, ""sommaire"" is spelt with only one m.
This is to say, Mr. Speaker, that it is obvious this was done in a hurry. Nobody had time to revise. I will admit these are minor mistakes but we would expect better from a government which has considerable means at its disposal.
I only wanted to point that out to the hon. member for Outremont who was taking pride in the fact that he could speak French in this House. I must tell him that I am very disappointed, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

I think it is interesting to support this motion since the member for Jonquiere showed a certain degree of courage yesterday, during four to five hours, when he rose to speak against the opportunity that was given members to debate his own motions.
The member for Jonquiere is suggesting the creation of umbrella committees. He also suggests that there should be a referendum committee in each riding and in each province and that there should be a certain spending limit. I think that what he means is that each province should be allowed to spend, according to its


Government Orders
population, amounts that would be fair for a referendum.
I understand why the member for Jonquiere is presenting these motions. It is because he was sitting on several committees to prepare for what was called a renewed Canada. I understand the member for Jonquiere because at least we realized that those committees were organized and planned by the government, by the Liberal Party, and that they were phoney. These committees were phoney because everything had been planned beforehand. They toured Canada and listened to Canadians from coast to coast, fully aware that their reports were already written. We realized that while the committees were touring Canada, members of the Privy Council and other government officials were in Ottawa preparing the committee's report. It was indeed a phoney committee and the member for Jonquiere, when he realized what was going on-

Let us say he did and that what he wanted to do with these motions, with these amendments to the referendum bill, was to put a stop to these abuses and make the bill a little bit fairer and more equitable.
Mr. Speaker, for the past months I have been watching TV at home and usually when we celebrate our country, or the Queen, or Dollard, it only lasts a few days. But now, for the 125th anniversary of the country, in Quebec we get advertising every 15 minutes on every TV channel.
It is a case of subliminal advertising. They want Canadians, and Quebecers in particular, to believe that they are living in a great country. We are shown magnificent mountains, beautiful lakes and rivers. That is all very nice but they have magnificent mountains in Peru as well. They also have beautiful lakes and rivers in that country. More great mountains can be found in Africa, in the desert, and there are many beautiful lakes around the world. That proves nothing. It does not show that five years down the road this country will be completely bankrupt because there are too many political powers in this country.
I was listening to the hon. member for Outremont earlier. If I were him, I would not have dared rise in this House, especially after having sat on the Belanger-Cam-peau and experienced first-hand this exercise in democracy the people of Quebec have carried out. That was a good idea to set up the Belanger-Campeau commission, and it showed respect for the public to appoint representatives from management, labour, the cultural spheres, the health sector, the three main political parties-the Liberals, the PQ and even the Equality Party, which is not really a party, with only two members at the present time, but it had three then.
They listened carefully. It was not a mock committee like the one we are trying to establish with this referendum bill here. This is an absolutely appalling bill. Personally, I cannot understand this. It is beyond me. In a country that claims to be democratic, to actually see such a bill being introduced supposedly to seek the opinion of the population while trying to manipulate it, that is appalling. You cannot manipulate people like that. The people of Quebec will not tolerate being manipulated. Quebecers are no longer the water carriers they are thought to be in the rest of Canada. Quebecers are educated. They set up and operate businesses. They are self-reliant and capable of evaluating the performance of this government here in Ottawa.
Right now the House of Commons is trying to pull the wool over their eyes. You think that is what will happen. You think that Quebecers do not see what is going on. Quebecers are currently watching and soon they will take concrete action that will turn against you people, who try to fool them. Quebecers have had enough.

Quebecers remembered those same Conservatives and Prime Minister Macdonald for a 100 years. They elected Liberals in Ottawa. Once in a while they threw them out.

I have another important point to make, Mr. Speaker. The Conservative government and the Liberals who support it-and I am not the only one to say that-just want to short-circuit the Quebec referendum. Quebecers took a serious step. They want to express themselves so the Conservative government tries to short-circuit the Quebec referendum. It wants to keep Quebecers from freely expressing themselves on their future, and that too is a disgrace. I hope that Quebecers understand-I am convinced they do-that members from the Bloc Quebecois are defending them today and are not going to be bullied.

It does not provide for umbrella committees; it does not limit the number of committees, so an unlimited number of committees is possible. In fact this means that there is no spending limit. So much so that the hon. member for Outremont asked earlier why have spending limits, while his government referring to its bill tries to have us believe that there is a limit of 56 cents per voter.
The government was not even able to get the member for Outremont to believe this, although he usually swallows whatever he is told. He told us, ""There are no spending limits; we don't need any."" He is right about that, I understand perfectly; it is for show-there is no spending limit.
Also the government is not subject to these tight limits. It does not have to disclose its spending or reveal its sources. In fact it clearly wants to buy votes. We will see. We have already seen. It has started an extraordinary propaganda campaign; we saw private broadcasters who will invest up to $10 million in a campaign that will start again in September. They said so clearly in a letter to all members of this House in September, a few weeks before the Quebec referendum deadline.
Government Orders
It is not by chance we are told. They will put out propaganda and we are told why. In that, they are following the example of the Liberal government in 1980. The federal government in 1980 did not comply with the Quebec law. It was not subject to the Quebec law so it inundated Quebec with propaganda leaflets. In a meeting with prisoners in Bordeaux jail I saw people who had received a pamphlet in prison touting the merits of Canada. It was headed, ""I'm here to stay"". They appreciated that a lot I can tell you.
I think that we are overlooking important democratic gains that Canada has made. I am thinking of the Election Act. It sets spending limits and other conditions. I do not understand why this government does not follow Quebec's example with umbrella committees and spending limits; it has worked well. Everyone has boasted about how democratic the Quebec referendum was. The member for Jonquiere uses it as a model but not the government.
We are told that the charter would not allow limiting spending or the number of committees, but the charter is there to support freedom of expression. We may ask who are free to express themselves. Those who have money? That is the answer the government gives us. Basically they are confusing the purposes of the charter with some of its technical aspects. The purpose of a charter of rights and freedoms is to ensure a greater measure of justice, freedom, equality, fairness; everyone should have the same right to speak. This bill totally contradicts that principle.
Nevertheless this charter has a mechanism to allow spending limits or to limit the number of committees without violating it. The notwithstanding clause could be used. The clause is part of the charter. Now, either the clause is faulty and we get rid of it, or the charter is acceptable in its present form, and we use the mechanisms provided in the charter.
I am in favour of these amendments, and I imagine the hon. member for Jonquiere will vote against the bill, unless it is amended. I imagine the hon. member for Chambly will do the same since they both said they could not accept the lack of spending limits and the anti-democratic tenor of this bill was unacceptable. I imagine that all the members-the hon. members for Richmond, Louis-Hebert, Rimouski-Temiscaouata, Bellechasse and Roberval, for instance-who took part in the 1980


Government Orders
referendum on the yes side and who all have organizers who belonged to the Parti Quebecois and who took advantage of the PQ organization, as well as part of the Liberal Party which in some ridings supported the Conservatives, I imagine all these members will remember their roots.
I would also like to touch on some of the points the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel raised during this debate. He felt that Quebecers and the Bloc Quebecois were scared. We are not afraid of a referendum. However, we have certain principles. We maintain Quebecers should determine the future of Quebec. That is called the right to self-determination, recognized long ago by the NDP and recognized with a lot of fanfare last August by the Conservative Party at its convention in Toronto. So far it has not been recognized by the Liberal Party, but that is also a matter of principle. They never said so. I had discussions with Liberals and I asked them whether they agreed with the right to self-determination. They always answered: ""We took part in the 1980 referendum."" But when I suggested they say it, their jaws seemed to lock. They cannot say ""Yes, we agree"".
I think Quebecers should determine Quebec's future, just as Canadians in the other provinces should determine theirs. It is not up to the Americans. We will do it in Quebec, under Quebec legislation.
I repeat, we are not afraid of this referendum in Quebec. Who is? The federalist parties are afraid of a referendum on sovereignty as proposed by the Liberal government. We are not afraid to join the very broad consensus reached by Belanger-Campeau. Three members remained outside this consensus: the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, together with Robert Lib-man and the ineffable member for Outremont, who did not even have the guts to say no anymore than he did to say yes.
The Bloc will support these amendments in order to show its opposition to the anti-democratic tenor of this bill. However, the fact remains that the bill lacks any legitimacy. If it were democratic, it would still lack legitimacy in Quebec, because it was rammed through at the last minute for the sole purpose of short-circuiting the serious process that has been taking place in Quebec
for the past two years, starting with Belanger-Campeau and followed by Bill 150, a carefully controlled process light-years removed from the Spicer circus, Beaudoin-Edwards, Castonguay-Dobbie and Beaudoin-Dobbie or BoDo.
Our process was not one of those expensive circuses like the constitutional caravans we have had in Canada for the past thirty years.
Mr. Speaker, we will support these amendments but we will vote against the bill.

John Bosley (Don Valley West):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,REFERENDUM ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, it was not my intention earlier to participate in this debate. What sparked it for me today, I guess, was that in some ways this is a special and historic day in the development of constitutional democracy. Not only are we debating this piece of legislation, as is proper, but one of the authors of the notion of supporting referenda legislation on this side of the House published a rather interesting book today. I thought at some point someone should mention that the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore deserves a great deal of credit for his support over the years in attempting to move many of us in the direction of this form of legislation or this genre of legislation.
I read part of it this afternoon and it reminded me that he and I have debated this subject internally and privately for many years. I am sorry that members opposite who preceded me-while we are on the subject of amendments with regard to spending limits and so forth which I will come back to-think that all there is to this process or all there is to this legislation is an attempt by some to muzzle the province of Quebec. I hope they will conclude at the end of it that that is not the intention of this legislation.
Therefore, let me put it to you this way. I do not examine this legislation in the context of whether there will or will not be a referendum in the province of Quebec by Quebecers for their purposes in their absolutely legitimate right to consult themselves about what they want their future to be. Should they do that, I hope they will conclude that they want to stay in Canada.


Therefore I ask myself the question I think members of the Bloc Quebecois should be asking themselves. Should that happen, and the province of Quebec feels comfortable about being in Canada, what should the legislation be that the members of the province of Quebec will be dealing with here that would govern future constitutional amendment procedures? Because that is what I think this is about.
It took us 125 or 127 years to get to what is an historic piece of legislation. It is the kind of legislation that, as the hon. members will know, five or ten years ago I would have said I would not support for all of the old and traditional reasons of ""I am a Tory"". My colleague from Montreal, the dean of the House, knows full well what that means. I am not just a Conservative, I am a Tory. I have old fashioned views about representative democracy, the rights of this legislature and the importance of this place. Both the Meech process and my hon. friend for Etobicoke-Lakeshore have convinced me that if we are going to make people believe that the Constitution of this country is their own, they are going to have some part in the process of adopting it.
They have to feel it is theirs and they have to feel ownership in it. The other way to say it is that those things you can change by changing the government may not need to be put to referendum. For those things that you cannot change by simply electing a different group of people to government perhaps you need a different vehicle to decide. What lay behind those who have been promoting this kind of legislation for many years, and I salute my friend, is not that this is about the admitted difficulties we face in trying to find a resolution to an existing constitutional dilemma. It may or may not be a useful tool. One does not know entirely. In my own heart I do not know the answer.
The member for Outremont will know that there are dilemmas for many of us as to whether the use of such a tool is a useful thing in the circumstances. One has to answer that question separately from whether Parliament should have this tool. After all these years in every town hall, every public meeting that I have attended on constitution making, the people have to have some sense that it now belongs to them. In the end, all of the consultation we do will be blessed if we have faith in their capacity to say that it is theirs. I think that is what this was meant to be.
Government Orders
Within that context, if I may put it in the amendments from another old friend, the hon. member for Jon-quiere-some members opposite are attempting to play the divide and conquer game-I accept that. It is sometimes done by members opposite. We never did it when we were in opposition.
I take entirely legitimately the intentions and the bon esprit of the hon. member for Jonquiere that these are motions that he thinks would be useful in amending the bill. I struggle in a different context with the notion of whether one could limit expenses in election acts and what one does with that.
I am on record elsewhere as saying that if we could avoid limiting what people spend to express themselves in election procedures, I would be for it. The only reason we have ever been forced to it in that context is the notion that we have invented a concept of limiting the rights of candidates to spend and that therefore perhaps we have to limit the rights of others to spend in order to defend the candidate's right to get through a campaign properly. Even now properly the courts struck out our attempt to say people could not spend anything. We are now dealing with election expense amendments that are trying to find some way through the need to control what can be spent in elections and at the same time to defend the essential liberty of Canadians to do what they want and to express themselves.
My dilemma with these amendments is that I think they probably come too far in the context of giving people the right to own their Constitution. These particular amendments come too far toward the notion of saying when we give you liberty, which we do not really give you if one thinks about it, we just really let you find a way to express your own liberty through referenda.
Then we should somehow say how you choose to express yourself and how you choose to group yourself needs as much control or the form of control we found necessary to put into the Elections Act. I have difficulty with that because essentially I am a libertarian. I therefore have that difficulty. That is my problem with these amendments.
I rose only to say in the context of the book that was published today that we may be down into the morass of the details, and we do that at report stage, that is sometimes necessary, but that is not really what this is about. In the end I hope it is not about the premiers. I hope it is about, I think it is about, giving back to Canadians a sense of ownership of the rules of their beloved country.

The hon. member knows I am a federalist. What federalism means essentially is that Canada is not a unitary country, it is a federation made up of majorities and minorities.
I do not mean to object to the right of a government to hold a referendum. What concerns me is this: In its wisdom, does the government think it would be right to hold a referendum to ask the Canadian people to decide? I acknowledge that. But what would happen if by chance an overwhelming majority, having English as its official language, decides one thing, while as we have seen before another majority, from my province of course, decides just the opposite?

I can see he stands by his principles when he asks this question.

I do not think a referendum is going to solve the problem he raises. It becomes necessary if the result is divisive. If the result of a consultation is divisive it will be necessary for those of us in this place who must ultimately make the final vote to reflect upon what that referendum will have told us if it achieves the result he describes.
In principle if you ask me the question: Because the anglophone part of this country accepts constitutional
amendments that are not accepted among the majority of francophone parts of this country in the example my hon. friend poses, is it up to me to be reflective of the duality of this nation and say we must therefore not pass those amendment? Yes it is, in my view.
That does not make it wrong to try to use the methodology of a referendum, national, local, or regional it seems to me anymore, to ask folks do you accept this notion? Eventually I say to them it seems to me it is logical that that step will become even more complete. It will no longer be in the terms of the technical language, a plebiscite. It will become eventually I suspect, in Constitution-making, true referendums. We will eventually be doing what the Danes did yesterday about the union in Europe. We will eventually be saying that in some form or other, the people of this country will have to make the final decisions about adoption of rules and that if they are rejected on a regional basis, they will have to be rejected on a national basis. It seems to me that is where this logically goes which is the only way that I can see in law to overcome the member's concern.

Mr. Speaker, you are the voice of wisdom and I would like to remind you that we are now in the process of examining the second of 64 amendments to this bill, only the second one. Since there is approximately 20 minutes left in this debate, it is obvious that we will not have time to discuss the other 62 amendments.
Mr. Speaker, because the government decided to resort to a gag order we will have properly examined two amendments out of 64. Imagine that one of those-and I am going to make all Canadians laugh-

In those two days, we spent more than half of our time discussing whether the title of the act should be a referendum or referendums. Just imagine. Do you have any idea how much one day of proceedings in the House of Commons costs? There are about 135 days in a year. Not many of those days are useful ones but there are 135 in all. The budget of the House of Commons is somewhere between $700 and $800 million. You can imagine the costs when the House wastes its time. The government did that purposely in order to avoid a debate on important amendments among the 62 that are left.
Later on the Conservative and Liberal members, among others, will vote one after the other on these amendments without having had one minute of debate in the House on those, simply because the government decided to cut off the debate.
You know that the two days of debate will end this evening, and with tomorrow, because the government will again resort will to the same procedure at third reading. Those three days represent one of the shortest periods of time to examine a piece of legislation.
If Canada decides to pass a law to protect small butterflies during the winter it may take ten days in the House. However it is not worth discussing for more than three days a Canadian referendum that everybody opposes, including Mr. Bourassa who said today that he hopes the federal government will not hold a Canadian referendum in Quebec. Moreover, more than half of those three days will have been spent discussing trivialities.
Mr. Speaker, you are a just and sensible man and I wonder if you have the authority to extend the sitting hours this evening, during the whole night if necessary, so that we can keep discussing motions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8? Come on; this does not make sense. We will not have time to discuss those motions.
As one who worked really hard regarding public financing, among other issues, I would have liked to tell you about those things. I found some interesting things. The Quebec Conservative caucus got involved. The Prime Minister had promised that it would be done before election time. He reneged on that just like he reneged on everything else, and today he uses closure to keep us from talking about this issue.
Government Orders
Mr. Speaker, you listened to me carefully and I wonder if you think that it is fair that the studies in the hands of the government House leader on the issue, among others, of spending limits, of popular financing, and of the application of the charter of rights are not made available to members? What does the government House leader want to hide from us? Where is the public interest in hiding the findings of a study financed with taxpayer's money? What do we want to hide? Why not deposit them on the Clerk's table so that we may consult them? We are not crazy in Quebec. We know how to read. Today's issue of La Presse headlines: ""A referendum calls for as rigid a framework as an election"". The article is by Patrice Garant, a Laval University law professor. He quotes judicial precedents, Mr. Speaker: the Supreme Court of the United States, in 1976, Buckley vs. Valeo; and then, a Manitoba case. Unless I'm mistaken, Manitoba is still part of Canada. He mentions the Belloti decision of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning a Massachussetts statute; he then refers to Mackay, another Canadian case, and applies the test set out in the Oakes decision. Why are we being hoodwinked? Then he comes up with another extremely detailed document, the Ford decision.
Do you feel that the supposedly secret studies or documents which the government House leader is deliberately hiding from members would not provide this professor, a political science expert, with greater insight? Is this the freedom recognized by the charter of rights? Is this part of the gag decree? Is it logical for the government to act in this manner? No more so than barring Bloc Quebecois members from the Castonguay-Dobbie committee on the Constitution, the various constitutional conferences, the travelling circus which criss-crossed Canada during three months, or the legislative committee which concluded its work last week and was a monumental farce. No witnesses were called. The whole thing was over in a day and a half, not even two days, barely three to four hours. The whole process was prearranged.
The Liberals, NDPs and Conservatives had agreed beforehand that there would be no legislative committee. The Bloc Quebecois, who oppose this bill, was not given a single seat on the committee in order that they might tell Canadian men and women, and Quebec men and women, what is going on. Some think they can convince the Canadian population, English and French Canada, English Canada and Quebec, by veiling the truth, by some fancy window dressing, by gagging opponents.

-you are in the House of Commons. You will see fair play"".

Where is this fair play? Is that what the House of Commons is all about? In French, the word communes or commun does not have quite the same meaning.
Were they telling me that the fair play of democracy, the fair play of the British, the fair play of English Canada, the fair play of English Canadian members, would mean gagging a group of members who had faith enough in their ideas and beliefs to the point of leaving this puppet government? Is that fair play? Is that what the House of Commons is all about? Is that democracy? Do you have the right to prevent me from speaking on 62 out of 64 amendments? Is that fair? Is that correct?

In closing, I will ask the hon. member for Megantic- Compton-Stanstead again and those like him who seem prepared to listen to their own speeches but not that of others.
If his constituents can express their views on the future of Canada, why is he denying that same right to mine, in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell? Why would the people of my riding be entitled to less than the people the hon. member for Megantic-Compton-Stanstead and others are representing?
I for one, believe that all Canadians have the right to express their views on the future of this country. Of course, I would like certain amendments to be made to improve the bill. But the main question remains: Do Canadians have the right, and should they have the right, to ratify the Constitution once an agreement has been reached, hopefully, between all governments in Canada? and I hope there will be such an agreement-
The hon. member for Shefford is asking: Has one not been reached?
Mr. Speaker, I think that, to most people watching this debate on TV, including members of this House, the answer to that question should be pretty obvious. In the absence of an agreement, how could we vote on a non-existent agreement? You do not need to be too clever to figure that out. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that most people understand that.
That being said, I will now let other hon. members have the floor seeing that there are a few minutes left. I want to thank the House for allowing me to make this brief comment and to conclude I would say that the
Government Orders
voters in my riding definitely have the right to express their views on the future of this country. That is why I intend to vote for granting them that privilege which I believe they should have in that day and age, today, on this 3rd day of June, 1992.

I would like to say a few words about some of the issues that have been dealt with and some of the ones we are not going to have the chance to deal with because of the time allocation motion.
As the previous member from the Liberal caucus mentioned, some members of this House did put forward amendments. Others chose not to put forward amendments on this legislation. I would like to indicate on behalf of our caucus, the New Democratic Party caucus, that the critic, the member for Yorkton-Melville, and myself, looked through the amendments that were proposed by Conservative members, by Liberals, and by some of the independent members of this House. We found that we could support a lot of those amendments. Regardless of what part of the House those amendments came from, we considered them on their merit.
On this issue where the government has been talking about a non-partisan approach, I wish it had taken the same attitude. I talked to members of the government caucus who put forward motions. I am told that the word has gone out among the government benches not to vote for those motions. That is what I hear. We will see what happens later on.
The concern I have is that the government felt throughout this process once we, that is the three parties in this House, voted to allow this to go to second reading, we went to committee stage and entered report stage with the idea that the government would be open to amendment. We were told that by the government House leader.
We indicated at the outset that we had some concerns with the legislation, not with the principle of a referendum, and I reject some of the comments made by other members of this House, especially among the Liberals, that we are against a referendum.

I will take 15 seconds to explain what happened earlier so that people who are watching this long vote will know.
When Motion No. 4 was put to the House earlier tonight, the hon. member was not in the House. Still that motion was brought forward even though it should not have been. When we arrived at a later motion, someone brought it up to the Speaker's attention and the motion was not put to the House because the proposer was not present at the time.

Since Motion No. 4 was lost, the next question will be on Motion No. 5.

Normally, when a motion comes from this side of the House it is votes for first on this side and then those who would vote against. It would start with the government benches and then come over here to the Liberals, the Official Opposition. I am wondering why on that particular vote the Liberals began on the second vote and then followed by a few Tories who needed to make up that number. Why the difference? Is that standard procedure?
