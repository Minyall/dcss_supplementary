A sequence of events took place in the House yesterday at approximately 5 p.m. that I feel is a breach-I hope the Chair will feel that way-of the clear intentions of the members of the House. It may have involved a misunderstanding on the part of the Chair. I hope the Speaker will accept that I want to put the matter in a way that does not indicate disrespect for the Chair.
It is an attempt to put right what I believe is a matter that has not been done right. It involves a matter of procedure.
In order to do that, Mr. Speaker, I have to very briefly indicate the sequence to you so you can understand the perspective of the members. I do not think I speak only on behalf of myself. There are other members who have a very clear interest in this.
In essence, the Chair yesterday terminated debate on a question before the House. In fact, there were two questions. There was a second reading motion and an amendment to the second reading motion.
The Speaker at 5 p.m., give or take one minute on either side of 5 p.m., terminated debate in the following sequence. It happened in the clear face of information which I believe the Chair had within his knowledge.
There was an agreement among the House leaders that the matter before the House at that time would have at least two day's debate. On Wednesday, it was clearly stated that this coming Monday the matter of Bill
C-63 would continue to be debated. That is clear in the record.
Second, the Chair had a list of speakers in his possession which clearly showed a continuing sequence of members wishing to speak to the matter then before the House.
Third, the Speaker had the benefit of two discussions with the member for Ottawa-Vanier which indicated to the Speaker at approximately 4.35 p.m. that he wished to speak to the matter, everyone with their eye on the clock. The Chair indicated, as I think the member for Ottawa-Vanier will indicate later, that the Speaker would want to recognize a member from the New Democratic Party and the Speaker did that.
The record shows that the Speaker recognized the member for Windsor-St. Clair at a point in time following 1640. Hansard shows the member for Park-dale-High Park speaking at 1640. That is on page 9942 of Hansard.
At a point in time following 1640, the Speaker recognized the member for Windsor-St. Clair. That member had, based on the rules of the House, 20 minutes to complete his remarks. If the full 20 minutes had been used, that would have taken him up to 5 p.m.
As the sequence evolved, the Speaker interrupted the member for Windsor-St. Clair. It was assumed by all members in the House, as I understand it, to be 5 p.m. That was when the Speaker rose and said to the member speaking at that time: ""I regret the hon. member's time has expired"".
Based on Hansard, that could only mean that we had arrived at 5 p.m. If he had commenced to speak following 1640 and if the Chair felt that time had expired, it could only have been 5 p.m.
The rules of the House call for the House to interrupt business at that time and proceed to Private Members' Business. That is what members believed would happen. That is what members on this side of the House believed would have happened, including the member for Ottawa-Vanier who had gone back to the Speaker in the Chair to verify that he would not have an opportunity to speak if the member for Windsor-St. Clair used all of

May 1, 1992
Privilege
his time. On that basis several members in this House had gone into their respective lobbies.
At 5 p.m., having interrupted the member for Windsor-St. Clair, the Chair immediately put the question. He said: ""Is the House ready for the question?"" He said nothing else. This surprised a number of members in the lobbies, as I understand it.
The Chair then asked if it was the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment. Members, still surprised, it being assumed we were dealing with a five o'clock interruption gave several answers which are not clear from Hansard.
The member for Carleton-Gloucester on this side of the House then rose in his place and asked the Chair if there was not a five-minute period of questions and comments now due. That is what usually occurs.
The Chair then said to that member: ""I asked for questions or comments. Nobody was getting up. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?""
That, Mr. Speaker, was an incorrect statement by the Chair. I am sure it was inadvertent because the record shows clearly that the Chair did not ask for questions and comments.
I submit to you that any Speaker in the Chair would have been aware of all of which I have already said; the agreement of the House leaders, the speakers' list, the discussion with the member for Ottawa-Vanier, the point of order raised by the member for Carleton- Gloucester, and would have recognized the desire of all members to continue with the debate. In fact House business for Monday is set for the continuation of debate.
In the face of that the Chair proceeded-it must have been five o'clock, Mr. Speaker-to deal with the question and call for a vote which no member was prepared for and in fact it required an impromptu intervention in an effort to delay and defer the vote until next week.
I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that-

Harvie Andre (Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons):,Minister of State (Without Portfolio); Leader of the Government in the House of Commons; Progressive Conservative Party House Leader,PRIVILEGE,BILL C-63,,"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from Scarborough who has raised this question of privilege is right in the sense that we did anticipate the debate on second reading of this bill would go on to Monday, and indeed from the government's perspective we were operating on that basis.
I was as surprised as anybody else when the votes were taken at five o'clock. I have examined the tapes and have watched what happened. I looked at Hansard and it seems pretty clear what happened. The opposition was asleep at the switch.
May 1, 1992

The Speaker heard the member for Windsor-St. Clair speak. There was no protest from the member for Windsor-St. Clair about being cut off so he assumed the time was done. He then asked whether the House was ready for the question. I listened. There is nothing in Hansard about any protest from any members. There are no points of order. Things proceeded in a routine fashion and when the second reading debate was held there were five members.
It appears that a lot of people like yours truly were watching the Ontario budget on television. That notwithstanding, we have a decision of the House which says there will be a deferred vote on this bill on Monday.
There was no ambush here. There was no collusion. There was nothing untoward. As I say, basically from my perspective the opposition was asleep at the switch.
However, what I would like to propose is that we agree to a House order that might say the following:
That, notwithstanding any order of this House, on Monday, May 4, 1992 the House allow further debate on the motion for second reading of Bill C-63, an act to dissolve or terminate certain corporations and other bodies, provided that no further amendments be allowed and that deferred division to dispose of second reading of said bill be taken no later than 6 p.m. that day.
I think I heard hon. members say that they anticipated, the Liberal Party anyway, two days of debate. I believe the New Democratic Party House leader would agree that there was agreement for two days of debate. I think this provides the extra opportunity for the debate to occur and I think this is the proper resolution to this issue.
Otherwise we end up with a long and involved discussion about who said what to whom, when in fact if we look at the record in Hansard and at a replay of what occurred on television it was very clear that there were no points of order. There was no protest at the time to anything that occurred and what happened was a natural, normal thing with people not being here.
I think this is the resolution and I would commend it to the House for its consideration.

The first point: I have reviewed Hansard, which I am sure the Chair has done and the Table has done. I am certain the Chair has taken the time to review the electronic recording of our proceedings. I am sure it will note that the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair started his debate after 4.40 p.m. yesterday. The tapes will show that the member was still speaking when the Chair interrupted. There is no way then that the House was still on government time, and therefore the question in my view should not have been put.
The second point: The Chair in putting the motion failed to ask for questions and comments. I know the Chair is paying attention, but I just want to emphasize that the Chair did not follow the proceedings, which was to ask for questions and comments.
The third point: The hon. member for Carleton- Gloucester stood in his place on a point of order and asked the Chair specifically if there was not a time for questions and answers, to which the Chair replied, and I say so with great respect, perhaps innocently that he had asked for questions and comments when in fact Hansard and the tape will show he did not ask. Others have used stronger language. I would prefer to use an innocent mistake.
The fourth point: If is was not after 5 p.m. when the Chair put the question on the amendment, it certainly was after the amendment was disposed of and he should never have proceeded with the main motion.
The fifth point: The Chair failed to ask for further debate on the main motion as indicated in Hansard and as indicated by the tape.
The sixth point: My distinguished colleague from Ottawa-Vanier will testily, if given an opportunity in these proceedings, that the Chair knew that he wished to speak after the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair. In fact the Chair and the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier agreed that since the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair said he was taking his full 20 minutes, my colleague for Ottawa-Vanier would not be able to get on before Monday. The Chair had agreed to that in discussion that they had at the table. My colleague will verify that.

May 1, 1992
Privilege
The seventh point I make is one of fairness. The rules of natural justice would suggest that one who occupies the chair for members and who is to serve members would want to be fair. I suggest that it would be terribly unfair if we were to proceed as if everything was fine in the suggestion made by the government House leader. I do not think that would be fair.
I would respectfully request that the Chair give serious consideration as to the consequences of this kind of debate and discussion on a measure which is important for the opposition as well as for all members.

I would simply say it is not unusual for this member to be relatively unconscious of the length of time that he has spoken. As a matter of fact, on occasion when I have lost track of time and expressed my regret for that, someone has said I could have always looked at the calendar.
I have to enter into the debate my own observations of yesterday. I can tell you with confidence that I began to speak shortly after 4.45 p.m. At about 4.58 p.m., the Speaker exhibited a number of distracting gestures of impatience that led me to believe that in spite of the evidence of my senses I had spoken for longer than I had.
It is clear therefore I was interrupted before the completion of the time that would normally be allocated to me. The record clearly indicates that the Acting Speaker did not ask for questions or comments, that he did not call for debate, that there was objection raised but that was dismissed rather quickly and the Acting Speaker continued to put the question on the amendment and on the main motion.
I am glad to hear the hon. House leader on the government side propose a possible solution to this series of unfortunate events. I think it regrettable therefore in this context that we hear such phraseology as the opposition was asleep at the switch. Given the events and the manner in which they unfolded, there being at the time as I recall about three members in the House, it is clear that there really was no opportunity short of engaging in an unnecessary and perhaps provocative exchange with the Acting Speaker to deal with the issue as it was presented to us. We were all shocked and surprised and therefore in some degree paralysed.
However inadvertent the series of events might have been and the acceptance on our part that this was not deliberate as suggested by the House leader, because that is not our suggestion, nevertheless I think we should be conscious of the fact there has been concern from time to time that these kinds of inadvertencies have occurred with too much frequency in this House when you, Sir, are not in the chair.
I think all of us would be very much more satisfied if not only this incident is dealt with appropriately, perhaps as suggested by the leader of the government side, but that care be exercised ensuring that this kind of unnecessary intervention in the process of debate be avoided by exercising greater care on the part of who may be acting in the chair in the future.

I myself was involved because Bill C-63 before the House is a bill that we on this side of the House feel is extremely important. I had indicated to the House around 4.30 p.m. that I wanted to speak in the debate on Bill C-63. The Speaker-and I repeat this because I want to put my experience of the facts on the record- who was in the Chair at the time, and I am referring to the Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole, told me that he had to recognize a member for the New Democratic Party. I agreed, because in the House it is the custom to alternate between government and opposition speakers.
I asked him at the time whether he knew if any NDP members wanted to speak. He answered: ""No, I don't have any names; would you check?"" I went to check, and I saw my colleague from Windsor-St. Clair. I asked him specifically whether he intended to take the floor. He said yes. I asked him whether he was going to take the full 20 minutes to which he was entitled, and he said yes.
May 1, 1992

At this point it was about 4.40 p.m. You can check the records of the clerks at the Thble. The records indicate . that it was 4.40 p.m. I had another committee meeting, so I went to this meeting because I figured: 4.40 p.m., a 20-minute speech, since the hon. member had given me the assurance he would speak for 20 minutes, and a 10-minute period for questions and comments-impossible, I would come back Monday. I went to see the Speaker and told him exactly this: Mr. Speaker, I will not be able to speak today, so I will see you Monday. He said: Have a nice weekend, Jean-Robert. Then I left and went to my committee meeting. The bells started ringing at 5.01 or 5.02, at which point we wondered what was happening.
Quite frankly, I consider that my privileges have been breached because the Chair knew that I wanted to speak and that it was impossible for me to do so yesterday, because according to the clocks there was no time left. In fact, I would also like to say something about the clocks. Look at the time. One clock says 10.29, the other clock says 10.30 and the third, 10.31. The Speaker's clock is the one that counts, I agree. But the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair was interrupted in the middle of his speech by the Chair and told his time had expired. That is impossible. According to the official record on the Thble, he started at 4.40 p.m. Now, the Speaker's clock may not show the same time as the clock used by the clerks, but the fact remains that the hon. member had 19 minutes, not 20. When the hon. member for Carleton- Gloucester rose to ask him whether there was not a period of questions and comments after a speech on second reading, the Speaker answered: I asked for questions and comments. Nobody was getting up.
We are dealing with members who take the Chair seriously. When the Speaker rises, members must take their seat. When the Speaker makes a statement, members do not usually question that statement. The hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester, out of respect for the Speaker, took this decision, this statement, this affirmation as a fact, as a decision by the Chair. In the Parliament of Canada, we do not question the decisions of the Chair, as you well know, Mr. Speaker. We cannot challenge them. When the government House leader
Privilege
says there was no collusion and there was nothing irregular, this is inaccurate because we never said there was collusion. We only said it was an error of judgment, a factual error, an error in time, and that in our view, a decision was made by the Chair that was misleading for the Liberal members. The hon. member for Carleton- Gloucester, out of respect for the Chair, chose to abide by that decision, which was unfortunate for us, because we lost our right to speak.
I may recall what it says in Beauchesne's, Fifth Edition:
117. The chief characteristics attached to the office of the Speaker in the House are authority and impartiality. [ -JReflections upon the character or actions of the Speaker may be punished as breaches of privilege. His actions cannot be criticized incidentally in debate or upon any form of proceeding except by way of a substantive motion.
As I said earlier, when the Speaker says something, we do not question what he says.
When our right to speak is restricted, when a restriction has been put on my right to speak, I say that some remedy is needed. I say there is something we must straighten out. Perhaps the Speaker's clock was not running properly yesterday or perhaps it was an oversight, but I think we have serious reasons to believe that this is a question of privilege. If this matter is not dealt with, I feel I will have to do whatever can be done to ensure that something is done about this situation.

I believe that there is genuine dispute as to whether the question was properly put. There is some difficulty because the Hansard and the tape cannot record agreements or undertakings that were given. We rely on each other's word in that regard and I do not believe anyone

It is clear that at least from the tape there did not appear to be anyone standing to participate in debate when the vote was called. However, I wish to reiterate that the issue before us is an issue of fairness. I agree with other speakers who have made that point. I believe that what is proposed by the government House leader is the appropriate course to follow; that the undertaking given to the other House leaders to continue the debate on Monday be followed through with and that the deferred vote be taken no later than 6 p.m. on Monday.

I want to point out that when I rose on this matter following Prayers at ten o'clock, in terms of Parliamentary time this incident was no older than about three to five minutes.
If one looks at Hansard, it is very clear that when the Chair called for the question, the member for Carle-ton-Gloucester rose on what he called a point of order. He was really rising to ask a question. The Chair inadverently, not realizing that he had failed to ask for questions or comments as he believed he had, did not pay attention to actually what was a request to make questions or comments. That happened within about 20 seconds. I want to focus on that timeframe. I believe that in fairness the Chair should be looking at that and recognizing that the Chair may have acted in a misinformed manner without indicating where the misinformation came from. Perhaps, even if we are talking about switches, it involved the Speaker's own clock, which he sometimes relies on in timing debates.

but they have happened and we are now in a position of that being recorded.
There has been a good deal of talk today about the evidence and what the evidence proves. As I listened, it occurred to me that the tape does not prove that the Chair did not ask for questions and comments, but neither is there any evidence that it did ask. There is some question about that.
Nevertheless, we are in the position in which quite a number of members wanted to carry on the debate and the government has offered a way of achieving what we all want to do. We do not want to be talking about this, we want to be talking about the issues. We want to be talking about the bill.
I have some argument about the agreement about two days. Certainly our executive was not informed that we had agreed in a House leaders meeting to a two-day debate. Neither have we disagreed. It was not decided. I understand it is not totally unusual for three House leaders to come out of that meeting with slightly different ideas as to exactly what was agreed upon in those meetings.
However, it would seem to me that taking the government House leader's suggestion and discussing the motion he proposes to move some time perhaps during Question Period or between now and Question Period among the House leaders, and coming up with a motion upon which we could all agree to cany on the debate on Monday, might be the best way of getting out of this at this time.

First of all, I want to comment on this because I do not want any misunderstanding. I have listened very carefully to our colleague, the hon. member for Ottawa-Vani-er, and I want him to know this.

I very well understand the concern of the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier with respect to the events of yesterday afternoon.
May 1, 1992



I say that because I do not want anybody to think that the situation that happened yesterday is something that the Chair takes lightly.
I also want to comment on something else. I hope that sometimes those who are so critical of this place will note what I am saying. There has been an attempt made today, an honourable one and a helpful one, to take the position that what happened may well have been inadvertence. Under the circumstances that is helpful.
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan has suggested that perhaps this matter could be delayed for a little while for further discussion with respect to whether the matter can be resolved by the suggestion of the hon. government House leader, which is to carry on the debate on Monday and to have the vote on Monday night without any further amendments.
The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest was clearly supporting the suggesting made by his own government House leader, but he did ask the Chair if its comments might help to guide the House. That is what the hon. member was reaching for. Perhaps my comments can help. At the moment I do not have to make this ruling, but I want to indicate to hon. members that it would be with some difficulty that the Chair, given what happened yesterday, could overrule a decision of the House. It would be a very difficult position to be in.
We have a suggestion now that while it does not extinguish the events of yesterday, it certainly goes a long way to meet the serious concerns that have been expressed. The hon. member Windsor-St. Clair was very helpful with the comments that he made.
I am going to put to the House the proposition of the government House leader, which the House has heard; namely, that the House Order about the debate on this bill recommence on Monday, that it proceed during the day, that there would be no further amendments and that the vote on the main motion would take place at six p.m. That is the proposition which is, in my view, presently before the House and I would like to hear comment on that.

The hon. member, when he made reference to two days, was under the impression that it was to be for at least two days because of the comments which were made by the government House leader and the fact that the bill was going to be called for Monday's debate.
There was no agreement by House leaders. Let me be perfectly clear. There was no agreement by House leaders that Thursday was going to be the end of the debate or Monday was going to be the end of the debate. There was no agreement by me and, it is safe to say, by my colleague from the New Democratic Party nor from the government.
We have clearly indicated that there was no agreement that it would be a two-day debate. Let us not have any illusions as to the fact that there was some agreement in the works behind the scenes with regard to a two-day debate.
I want to tell the Chair that on this side of the House there are in excess of 40 members who wish to participate in the debate on this particular bill. I do not want to go through all of the facts which have been put before the Chair.
Does the Chair think it appropriate and fair that we accept a government offer in terms of the debate of this particular bill in the House when the Chair knows, has read and has clearly seen the unfairness of the way in which we proceeded yesterday?
Does the Chair think that is an appropriate option?

I ask hon. members to understand the position that a Speaker is in given this difficult circumstance. I have indicated that it would be veiy difficult for a Speaker to say that what happened yesterday did not happen.
Whether I think what the government has proposed to the House is fair or otherwise is not for me to say. It is for the House to say.
What I am saying is if we are to find a resolution of this, then it is advisable for hon. members to take the caveat of the Speaker, which has just been given, that the resolution is probably going to have to be found. I am not absolute on this but it is probably going to have to be found by some kind of consensus in the House.
The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest can clarify this, but if there is the proposition on the floor of the House by the government House leader for the House's acceptance of his suggestion, then it can be dealt with. It can either be accepted or it can be rejected. If it is rejected, then I shall have to consider the matter further. Or hon. members may be able to discuss with each other a solution to it.

Having some bit of detachment from the issue, not having been in the House at the time but having had a chance to listen to the argument, I appreciate the quality of the argument we have had here today. My opinion is that there may have been inadvertence on all parts. I do not wish to escalate the debate at all, but I believe it is necessary to put one point forward. If in excess of 40 members were seeking to intervene, why did not one rise to participate in the debate yesterday?
That notwithstanding, I wish to honour the spirit of the undertaking that was given among the House leaders and I believe that the suggestion of the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan is a useful one. I can indicate to the hon. opposition House leader that the government is prepared to discuss the possibility of some extension of hours on Monday, if that would be helpful, and that the six o'clock time for the deferred division need not be set in stone.
It would be very useful to have an opportunity to discuss these matters perhaps during Question Period or as soon as it is convenient and perhaps to get on to other business of the House in the interim.

It may be that the House wants to discuss with the government whether Monday is sufficient or whether there should be a longer time. If that is what is desired by hon. members, then it seems to me appropriate that the discussion take place and hon. members return to the Chair if they have some advice to give me.
The question of privilege, if there is a motion moved, remains with me to deal with. It is not the same issue, it is a second issue. I am trying to assist the House to at least get the debate on again if that is what hon. members want.

If the Chair became involved in that kind of communication, it would only diminish its role in dealing with a matter of privilege.

The national launch of this program will be followed by regional events as part of National Trees and Forests Week, May 3 to 9. Tree Plan Canada, a forestry program of Canada's green plan, will show the practical and environmental benefits of planting trees.
This program gives Canadians a chance to become familiar with their forest heritage and also help improve our environment, for which we all have a great responsibility. Tree Plan Canada encourages various associations and organizations to work together in partnership on tree-planting projects.
Tree Plan Canada is the second forestry program of the green plan. In September 1991, the federal government announced the Partners for Sustainable Forest Development Program, which is in three main parts: model forests, the improvement-

The government's mismanagement of the east coast fishery is well known. Now there is potential for the same mismanagement in the Great Lakes.

I have to tell him that the health of the Great Lakes has greatly improved. We have now unequalled stocks of trout and salmon in the Great Lakes that we did not have before. The sport fishery is growing enormously in Ontario in particular because of this.

I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister noticed today that Air Canada has announced another lay-off of some 350 people. Most of these are in the management category, but I am also told this morning by the union

There is a great deal of fear now among the pilots, the flight attendants, the baggage handlers, ticket agents and so on that they are going to hear a very negative announcement on May 6. Perhaps it will be more lay-offs or perhaps more concessions from the people who are going to be working there.

The corporation's involvement with communities includes sponsorships for the arts, for cultural and sporting events or for other social events, which is a standard business practice.

As responsibility for the financial function is highly delegated, individual departments are accountable for the design, development and operation of their own financial systems. In this environment, the OCG discharges its responsibility through the establishment of a policy framework that includes criteria for evaluating software packages and design specifications for financial modules. Advice and assistance to departments in implementing the policies is provided through guidelines on project risk assessment and on auditing systems under development, by OCG participation on project management committees and by providing a list of pre-assessed software packages.
The future requirements for financial systems are an area of continuing focus for the OCG and in this context it has developed the Financial Information Strategy that, through the application of modern technology, will
improve the availability of relevant and timely financial information across government. The OCG has also been pro-active in improving support functions in general and, in partnership with departments and other central agencies established a Council for Administrative Renewal late last year to pursue opportunities to streamline administrative processes and systems. This new initiative will involve a fundamental rethinking of the way administrative services are provided, an increased focus on the optimization of government investment in systems through wider use of common solutions and the exploration of innovative ways for the delivery of administrative services.

the House and I much appreciate the tone and the manner in which members presented their arguments.
Having said that, as I indicated this morning, I also fully appreciate the concern expressed, no matter how politely, by hon. members.
I want to assure the House that I have reviewed the electronic record and the appropriate pages in Hansard. Clearly, the Acting Speaker did not ask on the record for questions and comments but the record also shows that no one sought the floor after the Acting Speaker posed the question for the second time: ""Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?"" I am stressing that because there was, of course, a question raised by an hon. member with respect to question and comment. Subsequent to that and what the Acting Speaker said about that the question was further put: ""Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?""
Members had the option then to also call for further debate and on the record no member attempted to claim the floor. Furthermore, when the Acting Speaker said: ""The last question is on the main motion, is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?"" again, the record does not show that any hon. member sought to debate the main motion further. Since I can find in neither record any objection to what the Acting Speaker did, I have little option under the circumstances but to find that there is no prime facie case of privilege in this matter.
I can say to the House that I hope this kind of situation will not arise again.
We will proceed with Orders of the Day.

I was proceeding as expeditiously as we had been invited to do.
Multi-level marketing is a product distribution system whereby a participant receives compensation for the supply of a product to any participant in the system who in turn receives compensation for the supply of a product to other participants in the system. There are approximately three-quarters of a million Canadians involved in this industry on a full- or part-time basis. They stand to benefit directly from speedy passage of this substantive amendment.
Before I deal with the technicalities of the proposal, I want to take just a moment to note the support the government has obtained from the two House leaders opposite, and more particularly from the hon. member for Dartmouth and the hon. member for Chambly.

Section 55 of the Competition Act has been a source of confusion for multi-level marketing companies, the public and the courts ever since the legislation was passed in 1976. Because of the problems arising from the section's application, a test case was brought before the Federal Court of Canada in 1980 so that the court could rule on the section's interpretation. In April 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the interpretation given as to the substance and constitutionality of the section.
The court confirmed the ruling of the Federal Appeal Court that selling schemes that involve payment of a commission for products purchased by participants in the scheme or of commissions for products that continue to be part of the inventory of the recruited participant would be included under the definition of ""scheme of pyramid selling"" in the legislation.

It was recognized, however, that the existing provision had a number of weaknesses, and discussions were held between the Bureau of Competition Policy and the multi-level marketing industry to improve the legislation. Specifically, the section did not adequately address several practices associated with pyramid selling schemes, such as compensation for recruitment; inventory loading, that is products sold to recruits in unreasonable quantities; required purchases as a condition of entry into a plan; failure to provide the participant with the right to return the product; and, exaggeration of earning potential by disclosing non-representative compensation received by participants.
These practices will now be strictly prohibited.
With the adoption of Bill C-68, consumers who could otherwise have been harmed by deceptive pyramid schemes will be better protected under the Competition Act. As well, industry will benefit from this simplified legislation which will remove some of the uncertainties surrounding the current wording.
Furthermore, all provinces affected by the proposed amendment I have just outlined have been consulted and have responded positively. Clearly, the proposed changes will improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of Canadian competition law as it applies to multi-level marketing.
In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I would like once again to thank my hon. friends opposite for their participation and co-operation in the consultations that have led to the drafting of this timely legislation, as well as to its speedy passage.

It seems that whenever he is involved in legislation in this House it always has a very high road approach, and I think as a result of his style and his approach invariably the legislation that he works on goes through this House in a very expeditious and constructive way. I think as parliamentary secretary to the House leader he will do a terrific job.
May 1, 1992

As he mentioned, we on this side of the House support this bill. I want to mention that my colleague from Dartmouth, who has worked with the government on this bill for the last little while, has likewise indicated his full support for this amendment to the Competition Act.
I do not think that Canadians realize what a large industry direct marketing is. We are talking about an industry which is close to $8 billion. We are talking about a sector that involves close to 370,000 small businesses engaged in the direct selling business.
As this industry continues to grow, it is very important that the practices be above board. It is important that people who are in the business and have ethics that are above reproach and approved by the direct marketing board get the assurance and the support of this legislation. It is also most important that the consumer is protected because it brings this type of business on to a much higher and a much more sophisticated plane.
I noticed in the legislation that any person who contravenes or goes against this new act is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine at the discretion of the court, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and on a summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $25,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both.
This is a pretty strong message to those people who are in this multi-level marketing system, that they make sure their style, their approach, their business ethic meets all of the requirements of this legislation.
This is an interesting way to end this week, putting through legislation in such sort order. Because of the state of the economy right now, I wish that we could bring in similar legislation which would expedite and help other industries in other sectors get on with their business in the same way.
So often the paper burden, red tape and slowness that seems to be attached to the legislation as it involves business in this country is part of the reason our economy has been so sluggish.
Our action today is what Canadians like to see in this House. I wish we could use the process we are using here
Government Orders
today where we put through a bill in such short order in other sectors of the economy.
As I mentioned earlier this week, we have the lowest interest rate that this country has seen in over 20 years, an inflation rate that is virtually eliminated in this country, yet there seems to be this lack of confidence in the marketplace. I said that these are positive facts, that the interest rate and inflation are low. But this lack of confidence is there. Part of that lack of confidence is that we are not sending a signal of leadership on issues that we control here.
We could be using a much more progressive approach in terms of tax reform in this country, especially when it comes to small and medium-sized business and also on the personal side. I guess all of us would concede that this being the week we do our tax returns, more than ever we are reminded of the complexity of the system. Yet we seem to be cautious in attacking the complex system that governs this country in terms of tax reform.
Even though the bill before us today is not complex, there was still the political will on all sides of the House that we clean up this sector of the economy and move the legislation through the House of Commons quickly.
If we could do that in many more areas then the confidence that Canadians innately have but are not showing right now could turn into action. We need to get Canadians feeling good about themselves.
People all over our country must have have had that feeling of total bewilderment as they watched television last night and saw what was happening in Los Angeles. Our neighbours to the south are going through almost a state of anarchy. I do not need to describe it. Every Canadian, I am sure, saw with total and utter amazement what happened in Los Angeles. I, for one, felt so good about Canada last night. I felt so secure and so appreciative of what we have in this country.
There are close to one million Canadians now living in the State of California. A lot of them went there because they felt that California was the place to be, whether it was because the tax system was better than ours or because there was a special job opportunity. I could not help but think that a lot of those Canadians living in California now are probably thinking and maybe appreciating Canada just a little more than they did two days ago.

May 1, 1992
Government Orders
It is important that we appreciate everything we have in this country. I believe we are on the verge of igniting the spirit of Canadians in this country again, where they can feel proud of all the things we should feel proud of.
I know this is a small piece of legislation here, but it is not small in the sense that it touches 370,000 businesses. I do not know how many people are employed in this industry. There must be at least a million or maybe more employed directly or indirectly. In effect, it touches the lives of a lot of people. When they see that we put through a piece of legislation in this House in less than half a day, they are going to ask: ""Why can you not do that in other areas?"" We have an opportunity to do just that between now and our 125th anniversary, which is a couple of months away.
Today is a very special day around here because we have the unveiling of the portrait of the former Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Prior to speaking on this bill, I said hello to him and congratulated him.
As someone who had the opportunity of working with the former Prime Minister, it is only right to say that, in my opinion, he was a person who is caring and passionate. Even though there may not always be agreement with his point of view on certain issues, he always took a strong stand and lead in a forceful way.
Whatever our point of view might be on various issues in this House, Canadians look forward over the next little while to a style and an approach where even though there may be different points of view, we do take strong positions and advance them in debate in a constructive way.
Whenever I deal with the member for Edmonton Southwest I always get that feeling. I salute him on pushing this this amendment to the Competition Act through the House in an expeditious way. Let us use it as a model to to get many more pieces of legislation through the House.

Caucus Chair,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,COMPETITION ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Madam Speaker, the New Democrat caucus agreed to this bill going through in one sitting or as has been said, less than half a day, but it is not necessarily the sort of thing that we want to make a habit of.
In this case it is good legislation. It is relatively minor in content yet very important in that it extends consumers' rights and gives consumers the right not to be misled. It deals with multi-level selling. I suppose most
people would know that type of selling better under the term of pyramid selling.
My concern about getting into the habit of passing legislation in one sitting such as this is because of one particular experience in the legislature in British Columbia when we did exactly the same thing. It seemed to be a good change legislatively. It was supported by both parties in the House. There were only two parties in the House at the time. It was done in a hurry in part because it was the last day of sitting before adjournment for the season.
To our chagrin, within 24 hours the legislature had to be recalled for an emergency session. Instead of making one slight change in the operation of a major provincial insurance company, we found out that what we had accomplished was to wipe out the company entirely. We had to be hastily reconvened so that we could reinstate the company. I think the change that we had tried to make has never been made to this day, but at least the insurance company is back in business.
The present bill is good legislation. We have had the time to study it and to be satisfied that it is not doing anything more or less than it says it is doing. We join in supporting it and in helping it get through its three stages.

Since the readjustment process is a statutory obligation under the Constitution Act, 1867, and the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, it can only be changed through legislation, and that is why, with the members of this House, we have agreed to proceed with Bill C-67.

The Royal Commission on Electoral Reform recommended certain changes in the electoral law of Canada which would deal with the adjustment of boundaries. The parliamentary committee on electoral reform, the special committee of this House, is studying that very issue. At some point it will, anyway. We have been slugging away all morning and most of this week in fact on these issues. We will be presenting a report to the House I trust in due course. It will not deal with readjustment, but sooner or later we will deal with readjustment. My guess is the rules may change.

Government Orders
In light of that possibility and in light of the fact that a readjustment could not be completed before the next election, the intent of this bill is quite satisfactory from our perspective because it will simply save the Canadian taxpayers about $5 million.
To that extent, we are delighted with the change. We recognize that there are some ridings based on the census statistics released on Tuesday which will be grossly oversized, and some will be grossly undersized. That is a problem that will have to be resolved a little later. I am optimistic that this bill is satisfactory from that perspective, and we are pleased to offer our support to it.

We did not like the original bill and made a point of that with the other political parties in that there was a problem that redistribution would not start for two full years. As just mentioned by the previous speaker, that could be very harmful for large population ridings which at the present time are based on the 1981 census.
We know there has been a dramatic shift in population. That has meant that some ridings are almost twice the size of other ridings in the same province. We thought a two-year delay could mean that not only the 1993 election would not be held on the new boundaries but that perhaps an election in 1995 or 1997 would not be held on the new boundaries.
There has been a compromise reached that would allow time for the committee studying changes to the Election Act and redistribution to prepare its report and at the same time allow for the possibility that there would be no use starting this process if we were in the middle of a federal election.
The amendment which will be introduced I am sure when we reach Committee of the Whole meets the objectives that we want. Yes, we recognize that there is work being done by the House of Commons committee on electoral reform as a result of the royal commission and that there are likely to be some changes in the rules on which we base redistribution. At the same time we did not want to penalize those ridings and those provinces which would be entitled to more seats as a result of the census.
I think the amendment which will be introduced in a
few minutes will meet our concerns, and with that in mind I will complete my remarks for now.

Given that this may not happen, it is a shame that this House will have to deal with another bill postponing this matter next April if an election has not been called by that date, which it should be.

At a certain point, a federal election would prevent the boundaries commission from doing its work. There is a lot of work that can be done prior to the start of another election.
In concern for those provinces that are entitled to more seats and in concern for those people who live in ridings with very large populations, including the members who represent those ridings, I thought that there should not be any undue delay.

A recurring theme in the recent deliberations over Canada's future is that we have to make some fundamental changes in the way we do business if our private sector is going to continue to compete successfully in an increasingly globalized marketplace.
To ensure their success in the years ahead, Canadian industries must learn to adapt much more quickly to rapid economic, political and technological changes. They must work to continually improve every facet of their businesses in order to compete with top competitors around the world.
In the agrifood industry this means using and developing new technologies and processes to increase crop yields; to develop a wider variety of processed food products; to ensure sustainable agricultural development and to ensure the highest possible level of food safety and quality. It also means that the industry must become more aggressive, innovative and self-reliant in marketing its products so that it can adjust to rapidly changing market conditions and move quickly to capitalize on new market opportunities.
The amendments before us will go a long way toward helping the agrifood industry become more successful competitors.
I want to clarify something at the outset. The Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act was originally passed to set up marketing agencies and has been used to create marketing boards in the feather and dairy industry. These amendments do not allow the establishment of marketing boards for their commodities. What we are talking about doing is changing the name of this bill to the National Farm Products Council in order to reflect its wider jurisdiction and to reflect the fact that the legislation touches more than just marketing agencies.
What is being proposed is to add a new section to the act. It will allow agrifood groups to charge levies called check-offs so that they can set up national promotional and research agencies for one or more farm products, agencies which will help and develop the products and processes they need to be more competitive on world markets.
These amendments to the Farm Marketing Agencies Act respond to numerous requests for change from a wide cross-section of the agrifood industry. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association, the Canadian Horticultural Council, the Canadian Pork Council, the Canadian Fruit Wholesalers Association, the Fresh for Flavour Foundation, Western Grains Research Foundation, the Canadian Honey Council, the Canadian Nursery Trade Association have all expressed an interest in national check-offs.
Indeed, these groups surveyed indicated that they would spend a portion of the funds on primary production research projects. We believe that the legislation will do a great deal to assist the industry in meeting the challenges of the future.
As well, the passage of this bill will send a clear signal to all Canadian industries that we are fully committed to making the regulatory changes needed to help them become more competitive. Competitiveness, of course, is a key element in the government's prosperity initiative. This is an excellent opportunity to put the words into action.
National check-off programs are also consistent with the new agrifood policies which are being developed by the government in consultation with the provinces, producers, consumer groups and other stakeholders in the agrifood industry.
May 1, 1992

Allowing the collection of mandatory or refundable levies to finance commodity based promotion and research agencies supports many of the goals articulated in the 1989 Growing Together paper. These include improved market responsiveness, shared responsibility for economic development between the public and private sectors and greater self-reliance to the agrifood industry.
Activities that could be supported by check-offs include market research, new product development, consumer education and advertising and promotion. Check-offs will encourage greater self-reliance because levies will be collected from the membership of the commodity group.
These proposed check-offs will not be imposed on agrifood groups. Indeed, no promotion and research agency will be set up unless a majority of the producers are in favour. Proposed amendments, therefore, place a strong emphasis on the wishes of individual producers.
In order to determine whether there is majority support, the Governor in Council may ask for a plebiscite. As well, the amendments provide for mandatory public hearings on the establishment of such agencies.
Furthermore, accountability to producers will also be ensured by producer membership on promotion and research agencies. Where there are no check-offs on imports, a majority of the agency members will be primary producers. These members can be appointed in any manner, including election by producers.
Finally, the National Farm Products Council will be responsible for ensuring that the promotion research agencies operate smoothly. If a problem is brought to its attention, the council will investigate and take necessary action.
This legislation will help level the playing field for Canadian producers. For example at present, Canadian cattle and beef producers pick up the whole tab for the beef information centre, but imported beef benefits from its promotional activities.
The objective of the check-offs is to fund research and promotion programs with two main goals: First, to
Government Orders
improve the competitive position of the product, and second, to expand domestic and foreign markets for the product.
In particular, it would support such activities as research into production, processing, distribution and marketing of the commodity. In short, check-offs would be used to enhance the competitiveness of the products. Until now, many of the industry's promotional programs have been ad hoc.
In addition, while Canadian products have a reputation for quality, Canada has lacked a national image in foods and has lagged behind in the development of value added. As a result, many producers and processors would prefer a more concerted and co-ordinated system whereby market promotion and development programs would be more aggressive and longer term.
Provincial check-offs have not been added within developing such a system. Therefore, producers have been looking for national check-offs to help establish such a system. Successful check-off programs could help the government achieve its target of 2.5 million new jobs by the year 2000.
Check-offs would permit commodity groups to develop market and promotion programs designed for the specific needs of their commodities. As well, they would give producers greater control over the establishment of research priorities and disbursement of research funds. This would give producers a greater interest in applying the results of the research.
We also recognize that in these days of intense multilateral trade negotiations, we must be sensitive to the possible requirements of new trade agreements. In this regard, I want to assure members of the House that our proposals do nothing to create an unfair trade advantage of the Canadian industry.
In the first place, the check-offs charged on imported products must equal those charged to domestic producers. We have no intention of breaking our international trade obligations. Second, where imports are involved, there will be representation from import organizations on the research and promotion agencies.

May 1, 1992
Business of the House
It is important as well to remember that beef, pork, potato and honey producers in the United States have check-off systems which apply to imported products.
The amendments we are proposing can provide our producers with access to the same kinds of check-off systems available to their U.S. counterparts.
As you know, Mr. Speaker, three amendments to Bill C-54 in committee were ruled inadmissible. The government then sought unanimous consent of the House to accept these amendments and received consent for two out of the three. The remaining amendment would allow wheat and barley produced in the Canadian Wheat Board designated area to be declared eligible for checkoff as part of the Promotion Research Agency.
This amendment was supported by organizations such as Prairie Pools, the Western Grains Research Foundation and the Canadian Wheat Board. Unfortunately the opposition would not accept this amendment despite industry's support. As a result, we must now wait for another opportunity to allow these farm products to be made eligible for check-offs.
Before concluding, I would like to address one myth that seems to have grown up around this piece of legislation and that is the belief that the federal government wants to get out of research and just let the farmers do it all. Far from it. Agriculture Canada is committed to research. Just last June the department backed a conference in Montreal called ""Partnerships- A Focus on Technology"" to get industry's views on where the research branch of the department should direct its resources.
As a result of that conference, the department will be concentrating on high-profile research the private sector is unable to undertake, newer work and value-added research. In addition, the Minister of Agriculture recently announced $170 million will be dedicated to funding projects under the green plan.
Agriculture Canada and the federal government remain committed to agricultural research. Bill C-54 will enable the industry to complement the research done by government with its own projects designed to meet its own priorities.

Ralph Ferguson (Lambton-Middlesex):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,FARM PRODUCTS MARKETING AGENCIES ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"Mr. Speaker, I am bit nervous about taking part in this debate today because I am very familiar with the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act. In fact, I was one of the charter members for the National Farm Products Marketing Council in 1972.
I was nominated by the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. It was a great honour for me to be involved in setting up the first three national agencies. The third one did not come into being until after I had left the council. When I was first appointed I understood it was only going to be a part-time position but before I ever started I found out it was a full-time position.
It was a tremendous experience as a Canadian to be involved in the negotiations with the various provinces, the various producer groups, across Canada which was really Confederation working at its very best.
The producers had asked for this legislation. It is only in a country like Canada where they would have come up with the necessary transfers of authority in federal-provincial agreements to made the system work very, very effectively. Very quickly it became the most sophisticated marketing system in the world. It has never contributed to surpluses that are of concern to us around the world, surpluses that are being attacked at the present time through the GATT.
Government Orders
We gained a part of that success through article XI of the GATT whereby the restrictions imposed on our own producers would be imposed on imports and therefore we could plan ahead to supply our domestic market and any export markets that might come along.
As these systems were refined they very quickly brought stability to the poultry farmers across Canada; a stability that is only equalled by those of the dairy farmers across Canada who had their own legislation that was brought in in earlier years.
If the purpose of this change is to enable the producers of Canada to adapt more quickly, and with better processing adapt to sustainable agriculture, then of course I have no problems. It is interesting that only the poultry and dairy sectors have the returns at the present time to adapt to sustainable agriculture. If we look at the problems gathering around this planet we have to be very, very concerned about the future food supply for generations to come.
This bill allows the Farm Products Marketing Council to provide the authority to the producers to collect levies; levies that can be collected if the majority of producers agree. Other producers are not already covered by this legislation but I should point out, as I understand the amendments of the act, this could also be used to collect moneys on imported products that are being sold in Canada and in effect be used to promote imported products.
When I look at this it is a grave concern because in March 1989 I asked the Minister of Agriculture what he was going to do about the million pounds a week of no-roll beef coming into Canada. Of course the response was it must be needed or it would not be coming in.
Two years later I asked again and the response was very similar. Just recently there was a regulation change that was supposed to deal with the situation. It is a regulatory amendment and requires that a beef carcass or a portion thereof, including a sub-primal cut, not be imported or shipped from a registered establishment unless the beef is packed in a bulk container and that container is marked with grade, name of the product, or in the case of ungraded beef, with the words ""ungraded beef"".

May 1, 1992
Government Orders
No-rolled beef is ungraded beef. When you grade a carcass of beef you run a roller down the side that stamps on the grade and in the case of Canadian grades it is grades Al, 2, 3, or 4 and then of course Cl, 2, 3, or 4 as cow beef. We had some changes just recently that include the triple A. The point is that the ungraded beef that is coming into Canada, even though a lot of it is boxed and wrapped, could very well be cow beef.
Here is the hooker on this new regulation which makes it meaningless. Even though the container or bulk container has to be marked with the name and the grade which is the Canadian grade equivalent coming into Canada, there is no legal requirement for the retailer to display that grade or the standard.
Here we are making it legal to collect levies that include levies on imported products coming into Canada in direct competition with our products here in Canada and at the retail level there is no requirement whatsoever to show what the grade is, to show the Canadian consumer what they are buying and consequently it will be working to the detriment of our own industry.
I maintain that any imported food has to be raised and processed or produced and processed, whichever we want to use, whether it is vegetables, crops, or meats, and processed under similar standards as that produced in Canada. On many occasions I have said in this House that we may have products that are not allowed to be used in Canada such as chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, or hormones, but imported foods can have a minimum level of those substances involved. It is not allowed to be used in Canada, we have a zero tolerance level in this country, but it does not apply to imported foods because of minimum standards.
I want to go even further. Just last night on Prime Time Live ABC television there was a program on meat contamination in the U.S. I am just going to touch on it very briefly. The United States Department of Agriculture has a Streamlined Inspection System, really giving the processing plants the powers to inspect their own meat, the honour system, and 20 per cent of U.S. beef falls under this system.
I was shocked at what we saw on that program and the conditions. I cannot comment on the authenticity of that
program, however they did have a letter advising a plant that an inspector would be coming on a certain date, giving approximately five days warning so the plant could clean up its operation before the inspector arrived.
They had 10 samples of meat tested by the U.S.A. Department of Agriculture and seven of the ten proved to be contaminated.
I am also deeply concerned about what is happening in the poultry industry. The Canadian poultry industry is one of the most sophisticated in the world. It shows a profit to primary producers under legislation provided for in the act we are debating today. I am also deeply concerned that the agencies established under this act are under open attack, an attack that started here. It is an attack against the subsidies being paid to Canadian farmers a year ago last October, an attack that started on the front bench on the government side when the minister stated that. There is $8 billion worth of subsidies given to Canadian agriculture, $2 billion of which goes to dairy farmers. In actual fact, there is only $267 million of subsidy going to the industrial milk producers in Canada.
We had a whole series of editorials and articles in the various media and even more recently, attacks by other people in the food sector against our marketing systems here in Canada.
On March 25 a representative of the Grocery Manufacturers Association made the statement that supply management costs consumers in excess of $5 billion a year in Canada. How could that possibly be? The total farm gate value of dairy and poultry products, the value the farmers receive for those products in Canada, only amounts to $4.8 billion. Are our Canadian farmers supposed to produce for nothing and then subsidize to have it taken away? Is this what they are suggesting? I suggest not. Farmers have a right to a standard of living similar to that of the rest of Canada. They have a right to an income that is commensurate with that of the rest of Canada and yet we are being attacked.
I want to say at this point that the Canadian consumer spends the second lowest in terms of disposable income on food purchases of any country in the world. Only the United States is slightly lower, a little over 1 per cent lower. If you look at food costs in capital cities of the world, Canada is the lowest. Right here in Ottawa food
May 1, 1992

costs are lower than they are in Washington, the capital of the United States.
What is all the fuss about? We even had one person claim to represent 2,000 independent grocery retailers. This person called himself the head of the Ontario Food Alliance. Incidentally, I should point out that this Ontario Food Alliance is a subsidiary of a very large distribution and retailing conglomerate here in Canada.
He questioned some of the statistics used when I showed the spreads between the producer price and the processor price. Spreads at that level are very consistent. The retail price went up dramatically over the last 10 years. He could not disagree with my figures because they were accurate. They are figures from the Agriculture Canada food basket commentary or Statistics Canada and they included specials. Specials appear from time to time in the various retail outlets.
He said it was misleading because when the farmer sells chickens, the head and the feathers have to be taken off and the body eviscerated before it is sold. The fact is we quoted eviscerated weight to the producer.
I should point out that within a day or two after the farmers protested here on Parliament Hill on February 21, the vice-president of a very large fast-food chicken outlet said on national television here in Canada that the reason chicken prices were too high here in Canada is because the farmer charges too much.
Let me say that one of those chickens is sold to the processor for $2 for the entire chicken. It does not matter if it is dead or alive, he got $2 for it. I never heard of a farmer delivering a load of dead chickens to a processor in my life. I never, ever got paid for a dead chicken. However, the processor got $1.50 for processing that chicken and cutting it into nine pieces and those nine pieces sold for $11.50 including the GST. That is a box of chicken, nine pieces.

I just want to go on a little further in that regard. That same individual from the Ontario Food Alliance stated that only 10 to 15 cents worth of wheat was required to grow a chicken. That is nonsense.
First, Ontario chickens are not fed wheat but a mixture of corn, other grains and protein supplements. In the cost of production formula that is used by the Ontario Chicken Marketing Agency and audited by Peat Marwick they determine the cost of feed for a kilogram of live chicken to be 47.27 cents or, if that chicken is grown for specialty markets as I am speaking of here, the cost of feed is 83.6 cents for that total chicken.
This individual only underestimated the cost of feed by 557 per cent! Talk about an error. In addition to the cost of feed, the cost of the baby chick to the farmer is 49 cents. If the farmer received $2 for the bird when it was completely ready for market, he would have a return of 14 cents a bird to cover his investment, labour, management and risk.
When people say they want cheaper chicken, I want to give an example of cheaper chicken. We have standards and management practices in Canada where after every flock of chickens goes through a bam, the bam is cleaned and in many cases disinfected. Our processors are under strict government inspection. We have the highest quality inspection system of any in the world.
I have an article about some work that has been going on in the United States at the present time. This one is from the May 26, 1991 edition of the Atlanta Journal Constitution, headed ""The poultry industry's hidden perils"". It states:
Millions of tainted birds make it to market, inspectors say.
I let some of my colleagues in on the gory details the other day, but I do not think I want them on the record here. It also states:
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, responsible for ensuring that poultry products are wholesome, is failing so completely that the distinctive USDA seal of approval today no longer guarantees that chicken is safe to eat, said more than six dozen USDA inspectors at the nation's largest poultry plants.

May 1, 1992
Government Orders
Even more recently is an article dated March 7,1992, a year later. It states:
USDA scientists have found as many as eight out of ten chickens tested are contaminated with salmonella, and as many as nine out of ten chickens tested are contaminated with (other bacteria). Millions of people become ill every year after eating contaminated meat, several thousand die.
If we want cheaper chicken, is this how we want it, or do we want the systems we have in Canada? I suggest that this legislation and the amendments before us today have another purpose to them. The pricing authority under the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act that allows the producers of Canada to price their products based on a cost of production formula is on the way out.
I would be very surprised if the national marketing agencies are not being stripped of their powers and will soon lose these price setting authorities due to the direction of this government. I would also be very surprised if the National Farm Products Marketing Council has not already received its marching orders in relation to the cost of production formulas used to establish prices for the efficient producer, prices that provide a return for management, labour, investment and the efficient producer. I expect these agencies will have to have abandon these prices in the very near future. They are under pressure to do so.
Let us look at what is happening in that system which the various pressure groups are pushing hard to do away with, claiming that prices are too high. First let me just say what happened south of us. In the United States the government spent $757 million to buy surplus dairy products, along with price supports that cost the average U.S. householder $100 per year.
As I said earlier, only our industrial milk receives a subsidy. Poultry does not receive one red cent and it has not since agencies came into being.
In 1983 the U.S. government paid its farmers $2.5 billion to remove dairy cows from the industry. That was a supreme sacrifice on the part of cows. They had to pass under the golden arches and come out as hamburgers. To placate the worries of ranchers who were competing for that same meat market, Congress has to authorize another $400 million to buy up the surplus beef that resulted.
It also subsidizes exporters that sell milk abroad. These exporters buy milk on the open market and sell
the product for less than they paid. However they are subsidized to make up the difference, plus a small mark-up. That government spent $46.6 million on this.
If we look at the stability and the economic foundation of that industry, they simply do not exist. A report of the U.S. general accounting office shows that between August 1990 and May 1991 prices paid to farmers in the U.S. for milk dropped by 21.5 per cent. However, milk prices in supermarkets fell by just 4.6 per cent and the price of cheese and other products only dropped by 1 per cent.
Who skimmed off the profits? In the U.S. dairy industry there is absolute chaos with thousands of producers being forced out of business every month. I read in a weekly American farm newspaper this week that they expect the prices to drop even further. Had they instead passed on those prices to the consumers, one university study pointed out that cheese prices would have dropped as much as 48 cents a pound at the retail level.
These findings are very similar to my study Compare the Shared Phase One that I published last August. Wheat prices in Canada dropped by 43 per cent to the producer between 1980 and 1990. Yet the price of whole wheat cereals increased by 192.4 per cent and soda biscuits by 235 per cent.
We have the best marketing systems of any country in the world. Why should we revert to something that is so utterly ridiculous as what is being proposed in the direction we are being pushed by some of the very large business interests in this country?
When I look at the returns to the agriculture producers in Canada, the five-year rate of return on assets including all government payments to the Canadian farmers but excluding farmer-owner labour, those returns were 6.2 per cent.
By contrast, Canada's food manufacturers have an average five-year rate of return of 16.9 per cent. One manufacturer had a five-year average return of 69 per cent and a one-year return of 192.7 per cent.
If this industry is to stay healthy in Canada all sectors have to have a return on investment, management, labour and risk. Five major food distributors in Canada had an average five-year rate of return of 17.1 per cent.
May 1, 1992

In the dairy industry, the return to producers is approximately 9 per cent, and in the poultry industry it may be slightly higher, between 9 and 10 per cent. Why all the fuss by the big corporations and the Consumer Association of Canada against our marketing systems?
Why are they not pointing their finger at others who are making far more in the rate of return than our producers? By comparison, the Canadian banks had a five-year average rate of return of 13.3 per cent.
Our food distribution system is doing very well. It ranks right up there, according to the The Globe and Mail's Report on Business, in the top 1,000. I am not taking a shot at the retailers at all. I want to put this on record.
The normal food retail store does not make a big return on the dollar volume of business because normally it is only perhaps 1.5 cents or 2 cents and sometimes it is 3 or 4 cents. It does not make a big return on that but you have to realize it turns its inventory over 27 times a year. In the food distribution sector, it is abut 18 times a year.

It is in its annual report, and guess who is going to pay the interest and pay back the principal? It is going to be the consumers of Canada who pay that back, and yet they want cheaper prices.

Government Orders
In the food distribution sector, the level of profits is slightly over 7 per cent more than with a comparable industry in the United States. I should point out that the average Canadian food distributor had 190 per cent more profit on sales than the average Canadian retailer in 1989 and 1990.
Canada put together the systems, beginning with the Canadian Wheat Board in the 1930s, I think it was 1935. It was, incidentally, brought in by the Conservative government of the day.
It was brought in to protect the producers of this country against the concentration of power in the marketplace at the time. Those powers are now being slowly but surely eroded by this administration.
I want to comment on a news article in which my colleague from Winnipeg-St. James was quoted recently. He pointed out that the flow of grain that is going to start from Canada to the United States markets is going to increase. It is a flow of grain that does not come under the Canadian Wheat Board system due to this government's action.
I should point out that recently I compared the returns for a 10-year period of the Canadian wheat producers in western Canada to those of the U.S. sales on-board ship in the Mississippi or the Texas gulf coast. Eight years out of ten, our Canadian producers return was substantially higher than the level of price received for that product.
This shows the value of this system to our Canadian producers, who produce the highest quality product of anyone in the world. They are obviously recognized around the world for the quality and their ability to supply the markets.
Slowly but surely that system is being eroded by the actions of this government. Consequently, this is the basis of my fears.
Something is very wrong in our system. Something is very wrong when this government starts taking away these systems. It has completely ignored the fact that five top companies in Canada account for 69 per cent of food distribution.
I am very concerned that we look at this very seriously. I am very concerned that the fanners of Canada are being sacrificed by taking away some of the powers they have now. They are being sacrificed by being told they have to compete in world markets and compete with world prices for our own domestic markets when their

Government Orders
input costs are about 25 per cent higher than those in the country to the south of us.
There has to be a level playing field and it has to include input costs, food standards and quality standards. It has to reflect the need for an adequate supply of high quality Canadian food for our consumers at reasonable prices.
I submit here today that our Canadian fanners, through the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act and our other piece of legislation, have met that challenge. They supply our Canadian consumers with large quantities of wholesome, good food at very reasonable prices. We have to maintain those systems and ensure their continuation. We cannot allow them to be chipped away and have their powers eroded.

I was very interested in what the speaker before me said when he took a very broad range approach at third reading of this bill and spent some time dealing with his concerns that the whole concept of national marketing boards is at risk with this government.
I believe that is probably the case, but in the 20 minutes I have, I wish to confine my remarks to the actual changes the government has proposed to that marketing legislation and point out what it has done. I believe it has probably set the stage for a very easy move to what it has been describing in its rhetoric as a new age of marketing boards, a new style of marketing agency. All it will have to do is cut part II out of the act as it now stands after today.
Part 1 of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act establishes a National Marketing Council, which my friend from Lambton-Middlesex served on and which he mentioned at the beginning of his remarks. This is the council that is made up of producers and consumers and sometimes other individuals appointed by the government to overview the marketing and the business being conducted by agencies which might be set up as national agencies under part II of the act. It is under part II that the supply managed agencies have been established since 1972. The agency is for eggs, chicken, turkey, hatching eggs, et cetera.
The amendments we have been dealing with in Bill C-54 are amendments which establish a new part II.
These part III agencies will not have the depth and the scope of the part II agencies. They will simply be established for the collection of levies for promotion and research.
Under the Constitution, a lot of members of the House who are here today realize that agriculture is one of the shared jurisdictions. As long as the agricultural product is inside of a provincial boundary it is guided by and is a provincial responsibility. Therefore, production in this country is basically seen to be a provincial responsibility.
However, once that product has to move in trade or commerce across provincial boundaries, it becomes a federal responsibility. Therefore, the federal government has tended to take charge of trade and commerce aspects of agriculture, of the kind of regulation that is required to make trade simpler and to get it into other countries because the federal government is also responsible for international trade.
What is being proposed with this new part III would be to set in progress a system that would permit producers to establish a marketing or check-off levy to be used for promotion and market research of a commodity under this new part III. They will then be able to go to the federal jurisdiction and ask for the power for those levies to be taken on the same product that is imported into Canada.
We have heard from beef producers and some of the horticultural producers. They might be interested in utilizing part III as a means of collecting levies whereby they could use the levies to promote their products in Canada and outside Canada as a means of expanding the market.
There were some problems that emerged when we began to investigate how this process might work. I would like to spend a few moments going through what I see as being some of the problems with this particular approach.
I have a bias and I will begin by stating that. The best and most efficient way for agriculture products to be marketed and promoted is through the kind of marketing boards that are possible under part II of the existing legislation. I speak as having had some experience in
May 1, 1992

this. When you go into another country to try to push pork sales, which was the case in my experience, or beef or any other commodity, it is much easier to promote that product when you are dealing with the potential buyers if you can sign a contract with them after you have convinced them of the great things that Canadian pork can do for them as Japanese businessmen, consumers or Japanese wholesaler-retailers. If you are able to sign a contract for the particular kind of cuts you have interested them in, then that is effective promotion and marketing. It is an effective way of promoting a product.
If you go over to the Japanese, in this case promoting beef which is not marketed under a marketing board in Canada, and convince them of the joys of eating, marketing and selling Canadian beef, and you have them all convinced and they are all enthusiastic about having some Canadian beef to market, they will ask how they can get this. You will say you will arrange a further trade mission to come over and maybe discuss that very thing and maybe you can get some of the processors interested in coming to talk to them.
Their enthusiasm wanes and the delay between when the processors may or may not arrive causes the whole effect of your promotion to have been considerably downgraded.
As well, there is a problem when taking this commodity-by-commodity approach and concentrating only on the promotion of the counter-promotions that are going to occur from similar commodities. When beef increases its promotion funds, what do you expect pork producers to do? What do you expect chicken producers to do? They too are going to retaliate by adding to the amount of promotion funds collected from producers.
In the end what you have is a system that does a very good job of collecting a lot of extra levies from producers. That is all to the credit and the good of advertising agencies which engage in promotion, but it does not put any more money in the pockets of the producers as a result. So there are some problems with the concept.
When we looked deliberately at the legislation, we noticed that new part III does not mention anything about the spending of the funds and accountability that the producer group so established has to comply with. There is nothing that says what proportion of the product
Government Orders
the levy can be against. It does not say whether it can only be on 1 per cent of farm sales or whether it can be as high as 100 per cent. The legislation is absolutely silent on that matter.
When I attempted to introduce amendments to the legislation through Parliament a few days ago, government members sat silent. When the vote came they shouted the proposal down when I proposed that the size of levies should not exceed one-half of 1 per cent of the farm-gate price. They wanted to leave it wide open. They did not explain why they wanted to leave it wide open. They were silent as to why. They simply thought it was not a good idea for Parliament to put limits on this and future ministers as to how big those levies can be.
The legislation is a little sloppy with regard to implementation. It says only that the minister or the marketing council have to be, and the word used in the legislation is ""satisfied"" that such an agency needs to exist.
Essentially, it is possible for a minister and his council, after all he appoints the council, to establish an agency almost at will. There is no real requirement for hearings, unless the marketing council decides to challenge the minister on it. If the marketing council and the minister are simply satisfied that such a promotion agency should exist, it will exist.
On the other side, there is no way in the legislation for producers to bring to an end such a promotion agency. I attempted to put in such amendments to the bill stating that where 5 per cent of the contributing producers petition the council, a hearing would be held to decide whether the agency would be continued, but that was shouted down by the government side as well when the vote came.
These agencies that may be established for collecting levies for promotion and so on also can collect from importers. I thought that it only made some sense if importers were consulted as well and were involved in the process. The legislation is not terribly clear on what role or how much consultation would be involved for importers either.
As I have already said, the legislation does not limit the size of the levy. We presume it could be up to 100 per cent. We suppose that the councils and the minister

May 1, 1992
Government Orders
would realize that that was far beyond the call of common sense, but government members refuse to allow Parliament to put a limit on this minister or any future ministers in that regard.
Another thing I am concerned about in this legislation is that it does not provide any requirement as to how the funds collected under these levies will be spent. I have spent some time reviewing a number of provincial agencies that have been established in the various provinces to do this so-called promotion.
Some of the agencies are extremely inefficient in converting a farmer's money into promotion and research funds. A great many of them put less than 50 per cent of the funds that they collect for the purposes of promotion and research actually into promotion and research. In other words, over half of the moneys collected are spent in the agency's own administrative costs. Often times these agencies have been struck in some of the provinces for the purposes of establishing an organization and a financial basis for a relatively small group of people claiming to be a commodity group. I submit that does not serve Canadian farmers very well.
I thought it only made sense for Parliament to levy some requirements through this act that the bulk of the funds, and I had suggested for discussion purposes at least 80 per cent of the funds, collected should in fact go for promotion and research. Again, the government members shouted that down and said that no, they did not really have to. We can accept by their thinking that virtually none of the moneys collected for that purpose actually have to go to that purpose. The agency seems to be responsible for that. The act remains silent as to what one would think was normal logic that the bulk of the funds should go for promotion and research since that is what they were collected for.
The act was also silent, although some of the government spokespeople mentioned their continued responsibility for research and trade promotion, on a firm legislative commitment that the federal government is still going to carry on the same proportion of responsibility as has been the case in the past.
That is important because the federal government's support and financial commitment to research and to trade promotion has not been keeping up with inflation and the proportion of trade that we have in the world. They have been backing off from their responsibility.
Some of us fear that new part III in this legislation will be used as a crutch on the part of this government to encourage farmers to go out and collect their own money if they have a particular research project or particular type of promotion they want to do. The government will simply use part III to get away from their longstanding commitments in this area and simply tell the farmers: ""Look, you have the power under part III of this national Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act to go out and collect the funding for that and to fund it yourself. We wash our hands of responsibility for this"".
Because of all of the shortcomings in the legislation, I think it will be of dubious utility to the farming community. Its effectiveness and efficiency are not going to be great for the reasons I have outlined because of the cross-commodity competition that it will engender and the ineffectual means that the commodity groups will be limited to in terms of pushing new products and pushing into new markets.
Even though the government says that this bill is attempting to enhance competitiveness, it has missed a great opportunity to encourage producers in this country to use part II of the old legislation which would have made Canada's producers more competitive. It would have given producers of more commodities a chance to expand into new markets in a meaningful way that would have provided a true system of integrated market penetration where the promotion, the research and the product all follow together because they are under one roof and on one desk through a national marketing agency.
The producer check-offs that are used now are certainly less than efficient. A great many of them spend less. They spend barely half of the funds collected. Some of them spend less than half of the funds they collected on the purposes for which they were collected, namely promotion and research.
May 1, 1992

I do not expect great things from this. I do hope, however, that the suspicions of my hon. friend who spoke before me from Lambton-Middlesex are not borne out, that in fact the government does not have in the back of its mind as part of its long-term plan to do away with existing national marketing agencies.
Part II continues to be a vital part of the marketing system in the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act. The government will begin to encourage producers of other products to use that part of the act to set up national agencies, not just for supply management purposes but as single desk selling agencies and function like the Canadian Wheat Board for the international sales of wheat and barley. This kind of an agency could be set up for a more directed marketing approach for pork, potatoes or apples. This is the way for Canadians to penetrate world markets. It is the most logical approach.
I only regret that the government did not choose to put its efforts into making part II agencies work better instead of creating a side show with these part III agencies which I contend will be expensive, inefficient and quite ineffectual.

Since my colleague described the present situation in the United States with respect to grading and the inspection system, we are inclined to think that we here in Canada are far ahead of our southern neighbours when it comes to inspection and ensuring that all products on the market are in perfect condition and safe for the consumer.
My colleague from Lambton-Middlesex indeed showed that this bill in particular goes a little farther than was believed, in that the supply management system that we have here in Canada has served our farmers well. As my colleague showed, poultry producers are assured of reasonable prices that meet their production costs, but we see that their profit margin is very small.
Where is the problem, he asks, and so do I? We guarantee a product that meets all the inspection requirements and our standards are among the highest if
Government Orders
not the highest in the world. Products in Canada are sold at a very reasonable price when you consider that retail prices are merely 1 per cent higher here than in the United States. As the hon. member said, we have in Ottawa the best prices that can be found in any capital in the world.
The question is then, as my hon. colleague asked, where is the problem? Indeed, what major national, transnational and multinational companies have in mind is to maximize profits. And so they will, but at what price? Would we be prepared to compromise Canada's good name by selling substandard products, whether it be eggs, poultry or beef for that matter?
In southern states, according to a U.S. T.V. broadcast, the market is severely flawed. My colleague from Lambton-Middlesex has clearly showed, with positive proof, that we have an extraordinary advantage here in Canada, in that our prices are among the best in the world.
We should therefore look out and it is the role of the members of this House to look after the best interest of all Canadians. We cannot count on big companies or multinationals to satisfy perfect health requirements. We saw in the United States the big corporations leave that aside. The inquiries that were made revealed serious flaws.
In Canada, it is obvious that we cannot have that. However, if we let the situation deteriorate to the point where the biggest stakeholders would literally dictate to the government the conditions for ""productive"" production, if we want to be competitive, there is a limit. I do not think anybody is opposed to ensuring that the inspection is conducted and that no detail is overlooked to ensure compliance with all the sanitary requirements as regards agricultural production as a whole in Canada.
As my colleague demonstrated, this bill as a whole presents a risk and we must be aware of that. It is obvious that Canadian farmers are not among the richest people in the country. Given the number of hours they work, those farmers are entitled to a reasonable profit. The figures all show-and they are not from me nor from my colleague, but from Statistics Canada-that our farmers make a profit that is below average if you look at all the businesses in the country.
Our role here, and especially the role of the government, which is responsible for the administration of the country, is to guarantee to the population that our production cannot in any way, be contaminated, that we can be assured that all products meet those requirements that are so important for the population.

May 1, 1992
Government Orders
In concluding, I hope, as my colleague mentioned, that we will be vigilant concerning this issue and that we will ensure that all farm products meet those requirements. You can meet those requirements when you are guaranteed a certain price. The inspection that will then be carried will ensure sound management to the Canadian consumers.
