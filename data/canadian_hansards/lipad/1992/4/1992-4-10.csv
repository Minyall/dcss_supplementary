Langdon (Essex-Windsor):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Madam Speaker, I think three minutes should be just about enough to point out to this government how the incompetence, irresponsibility and lack of sensitivity to the human damage which it is causing has come clear this morning in the dramatic increase in unemployment rates which has taken place in this country.
We see today an increase in unemployment rates to 11.1 per cent across this country. That is the highest level which we have seen in Canada since 1985. For adult males over the age of 25, we have a level of unemployment of 10.4 per cent, which is higher than in the recession of 1982.
What we have here is a government which has presided over the loss of 146,000 full-time jobs in this past month; 146,000 jobs in a single month. How can we possibly have any confidence in the economic management of this government? It is a government which has had no success in dealing with the deficit, no success in dealing with unemployment, no success in dealing with
poverty in this country, which has created increased inequality across this country, which has given tax handouts to its friends, as I discussed yesterday in the first part of my speech, and which continues to misunderstand the bitterness, the anger, the unhappy tragedy which is out there for Canadians across this country.
This is a government which is failing this country, failing it economically and, through that economic failure, failing to build this country for the future.
Yesterday, a promising development took place in Halifax with respect to constitutional change in this country. But those promising developments in constitutional change are not going to bring unity in this country so long as this government is creating two Canadas, one that is rich and privileged and powerful and another that, as these figures show today, is increasingly unemployed, increasingly powerless, increasingly left out of any kind of economic opportunity here in this country.
We cannot support anything that comes from this government pretending to be economic policy which in effect will have the result of continuing the tax handouts to large corporations and tax hand-outs to the rich, which created the economic mess which we see in front of us at the moment.
This government has failed. This bill is a sign of its failure. I hope this House will reject this piece of legislation on that basis.

Indeed, the unemployment numbers released this morning, as the member has suggested, show a dramatic increase month over month in the level of unemployment in Canada. We have been accustomed in this House to seeing an increase from 10.1 to 10.2 or 10.2 to 10.4, but I think Canadians have to wrap their minds around the reality that in one month, in just 30 days, unemployment in Canada increased from 10.6 to 11.1 per

Government Orders
cent. In one month another 100,000 Canadians went on the unemployment lines. During the period of one month, every day of that month more than 3,000 more Canadians a day went unemployed. If the trend continues, this very day that we speak, before the day is out, 3,000 more Canadians will be unemployed across this country. .Three thousand more notices a day are being given for jobs that have disappeared.
That is an incredible rate. That is a tragic rate of job loss in this country. What makes it tragic is that this job loss follows quickly on the heels of a budget introduced February 25, a budget that was advertised as a stand pat budget, a budget for recovery, a budget that would allow the natural market forces to do their work, to stimulate this economy and to put Canadians back to work.
I want to ask my hon. friend, who has been a finance spokesman for his party, a trade spokesman for his party, whether he believes the budget delivered by the Minister of Finance, the first budget delivered by this current Minister of Finance, can still in any way, shape or form be called relevant and appropriate, given the current economic circumstances and given what looks to be like the first tentacles of a vicious recession-not a recession, but a depression gripping this country.

We used to read stories as young kids growing up. One of my favourite stories was the story of the emperor who had beautiful clothes which were being spun for him, clothes which were supposed to dress him in splendour. It took one child to look at that emperor, start laughing and say: ""He hasn't any clothes on,"" for the emperor to suddenly realize that he had been fooled.
I think that we have a situation in this country where a government has, with pomp and circumstance and splendour brought in a budget, pretending that that budget would do something about our economic problems. Ever since that budget has come out, there has been one piece of information after another which has said that the budget was threadbare, that the budget was ultimately non-existent and that the government stood there with absolutely nothing on in trying to deal with the problems of our country.
Just this past week we saw a reduction in housing starts. We see again, just this past week, reports of all sorts. The Royal Bank which gives to this government $50,000 or $60,000 a year in campaign contributions, nevertheless had to admit that the government's growth projections of 2.7 per cent were absolutely crazy.
In fact, the level of growth that could be expected in this economy was simply 1.4 per cent, less than half of what the government expected. We see today the final shock which I hope, because I care for these people who are being affected, will change this government's mind.
I hope that the shock of seeing this kind of dramatic, powerful rise in unemployment will force this government to change policy, force it to reduce interest rates significantly and force it to adopt a municipal infrastructure job plan, force it, through an economic recovery fund, to keep companies operating so that we keep people at work, force it to recognize that it has to extend the RRSP proposal to renovations so as to get more people back to work, force it to recognize that over the longer term it has to have an industrial strategy to get our industrial sectors back competitively throughout this country.
Across this country, there is a sense of despair which will be increased by the unemployment figures this morning. I plead with this government, please do something to respond. Show that you care, because people across this country need that sense of hope which they do not have in this government's present budget policies.

The bill now before Parliament would ensure that the government, through legislative control, would follow the spending program that has been laid down by the government for a five-year period. Through this bit of smoke and mirrors, through this so-called legislative control of the government's spending program, the government attempts to convince Canadians that it is going to be responsible in how it spends taxpayers' moneys.
April 10, 1992

More to the point, the government is attempting to enforce its expenditure program not only on this current government but on succeeding governments. It is really a bit of nonsense. If the government wants to operate in a responsible fashion with respect to expenditures, then all the government need do is ensure that cabinet functions in a responsible way. If ministers do not function in a responsible way then all the Prime Minister need do is fire them.
With nearly eight years in power, to put forward legislation that purports to control expenditures and suggests that it is being fiscally responsible is pure nonsense. It is more propaganda. It is a deathbed repentance by a government that is on its last legs. It is a government that has fully the support of 10 per cent or 11 per cent of the population appealing to the 90 per cent that has left this government in terms of their political support. It is propaganda.
Speaking of propaganda, this morning I picked up a newspaper and I read the following headline: ""Wilson Defends Spending Millions on Free Trade Success Stories"". Canadians ought to think about that. The minister of trade is going to launch a multimillion dollar advertising campaign to tell Canadians about the great success of free trade.
Members opposite should be ashamed of themselves. You would want to have the face of a robber's horse to propose spending millions of dollars to say how good free trade is. Can you imagine?
Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition asked the minister of trade if, rather than have a propaganda campaign, would it not be better to use that money to help the hundreds and thousands of Canadians who have lost their jobs because this government could not do a good job in negotiating the free trade deal.
That was the question put by the Leader of the Opposition, and the answer from the minister of trade- and we need to hear this answer in the face of the unemployment stats this morning-was whether his hon. friend was saying that he is against providing advertising, providing information to Canadians, to let them know of the successes.
This morning the unemployment stats came out. Here is the story. We do not need advertising. It says that unemployment in Canada has gone from 10.6 per cent up to 11.1 per cent. It says that 1.6 million Canadians are
Government Orders
unemployed. It says that in excess of two million Canadians have given up even looking for work and have registered at the welfare agencies all across this country. They are not even looking any more.
We have upward of four million Canadians who are out of a job productive cycle in this country and the minister of trade, that sensitive, that caring, that plugged in, that realistic, that heart-beating Canadian from Bay Street wants to buy advertising to tell Canadians that there are some success stories.
Mr. Speaker, I am from Newfoundland, not Disneyland, and I am tired of this fantasy propaganda effort by the government opposite.
We have become like the people who used to watch the nightly news during the Vietnam war. We have become immune to the body bags. We have the numbers every month, 11.1 per cent, four million Canadians, 1.6 unemployed, and it does not register any more. We have become numb to the human face of unemployment. We have forgotten to care. We have been so battered and broken and bullied and pushed and pounded, month after month, by the tragic plight of unemployment in Canada that our nerve endings are numbed. We have stopped caring.
The government's response is that it is going to buy advertising. It is going to spend millions of dollars to tell those four million lost souls, to tell the man who has lost the dignity of a pay cheque, the woman who has been driven out of the work force, the children who have been dislocated and moved from their homes because the banks have grabbed up the mortgage and taken back the home, it is going to tell those poor lost unfortunate souls that there really are success stories, Virginia. There really is a Santa Claus. There are some people who are succeeding under free trade in Canada.
That is the most brutal, that is the most cynical kind of approach to government that one can possibly imagine. It is adding insult to injury. It is saying that this government believes that the level of intelligence, the level of conscientiousness the level of awareness, the level of sensitivity of the average Canadian can be defined by the cost of an advertising campaign.
This government is so convinced that the people of Canada live in little bunkers called houses and that they are so turned off by the plight of their neighbours, that if it can reach them by an ad on radio, television or in a newspaper it can communicate what is going on in this country.

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
Canadians are out in the streets talking to their neighbours, their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, their cousins. They know that this economy is in a free fall. They know what no one dares to say and that is that we are not in a recession. This is not a recession we are living in; this is a depression.
Canada has entered a depression. An unemployment rate increase of 100,000 in one month. Three thousand people a day, each and every day for the last 30 days have been laid-off. That is not a recession. That is not slow growth. The country is in a depression.
The budget brought down by the Minister of Finance on February 25 as everyone well knows was an act of cowardice. It was turning away from the tough challenge of putting this country back to work.
We have heard many members of Parliament from all across Canada echoing that message. In particular we have seen many provincial members visiting the national capital coming from the poorer provinces which have had transfer payments for health care and education, CAP transfer payments. Some provinces were put on the Canada Assistance Plan unilaterally introduced by this government. They come to Ottawa and say: ""My God, do you realize what is happening out there in the street, in real Canada?""
In just the last few days, I have had the opportunity of talking to members from the province of Nova Scotia. I spoke to Daniel Graham for Inverness South, Charles MacArthur for Inverness North and to Kenny MacAskill for Victoria, who are here in Ottawa making their case, telling the parliamentarians in this Chamber, telling members on the other side that it is time to recognize the real face of unemployment, the real face of human misery that is felt out there in the land. When members take the trouble to come from the other legislatures of this country and to convey that message, we have an obligation to listen.
What has happened in Canada in the last 30 days? What has happened since the budget was brought down in February across this land?
Let me talk about my own province. Unemployment in Newfoundland has now reached 20.3 per cent, a full 1.4 per cent increase. Not half a per cent, not a third of a per cent, but a full 1.4 per cent increase over one month. From 18.3 per cent in March 1991 to 20.3 per cent in
April 1992. How does that translate? It means that on the Avalon peninsula of Newfoundland, 18.8 per cent of the work force, those who have still bothered to register at Canada employment offices, are unemployed.
In the riding of my colleague from Gander-Grand Falls, who has spoken with such power, eloquence, passion and conviction about the people of his riding in this Chamber, it means that 22.7 per cent of the work force is unemployed.
In the riding of my friend the member for Bonavista- Trinity-Conception, it means that 20 per cent of the work force today are unemployed. That includes 1,000 fish plant workers in Catalina who lost their jobs because of foreign overfishing. Their jobs were closed down. My hon. friend spoke in this House with passion and with dignity on their behalf asking that their voice be heard and considered by this government. Just like the body bags in the Vietnam war it did not even crack a dent. It made no impact. It was like hitting the battle armour of an M-l tank. The news of those 1,000 jobs lost just bounced off and deflected. The government went straight ahead with its economic plan ignoring all of those people whose lives had been put on hold while this government continued to flounder and to flail and to offer more confusion, conflict and contradiction in its own ranks with the inability to deal with the reality of unemployment.
In western Newfoundland and Labrador, in my own riding, unemployment this month has gone to 23.6 per cent. There are 13,000 people who have registered and are unable to find work. This government's answer is: ""Recovery is around the comer"".
The Royal Bank announced just two days ago that its own projections for recovery in Canada were being scaled down from nearly 3 per cent, 2.7 per cent, to 1 per cent at best.
. The Royal Bank officially said that there will be no recovery in 1992 based on the current economic policy and plan of the government. It said that there will not be a recovery until 1993. Well the Royal Bank ought to get honest with Canadians. It should quit the soft sell. It should quit the mush. It should be honest and say that the country is moving into a long-term depression. The country is bleeding.
April 10, 1992

The same minister of trade who negotiated the free trade deal, who at the last second went to Washington in the dead of the night and signed on the dotted line on behalf of Canada on a free trade deal, the former Minister of Finance, the current minister of trade, now says: ""You can trust me to sign and to negotiate the Canada-U.S.-Mexico deal because I am the guy who gave you the free trade deal"".
What has been the result of the free trade deal? The result is that 300,000 highly paid manufacturing jobs in southern Ontario have gone. They have not gone for a week, or a month, or a year. They are gone forever because that manufacturing capacity, that manufacturing power base has been transferred to the United States. It is gone. They have not given a lay-off notice; they have levelled the factory. They have not told people to take a break; they have broken down the assembly lines and moved them south of the border.
The so-called most massive adjustment programs ever known in the history of the free world promised by the Prime Minister, adjustment programs and retraining programs, are nowhere to be seen in this country.
Canada needs a new economic program. Canada needs a recognition of how difficult times are in this country. I saw the news last night and the news was that the Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs felt a renewed degree of confidence in the possibility of negotiating a constitutional deal. That is good news. I hope there is progress and that it stands up.
But by God, we have to realize in this place that the capacity of a country to heal itself constitutionally, to come together constitutionally, the capacity of a country to reach into its soul and find the generosity to unite is directly related to our capacity to put bread and butter on the table and to have the dignity of receiving a pay-cheque at the end of every pay period. They are inseparable.
Governments that believe they can negotiate constitutions in isolation of the human circumstance of the men and women of a country are governments that are living in fantasy land.
I feel, in a sense, that my voice is wasted here today because this Chamber is going to close for a scheduled break for the next two weeks and it is a Friday. It is the
Government Orders
last day of the week. It is the last day before we go away for 14 days. I ask myself whether anybody opposite is going to spend one moment of time, Mr. Speaker, other than you whom I know we can count upon, contemplating the real meaning of this dramatic increase in unemployment.
I wonder whether one minister opposite is going to go away and face up to the reality that the current economic plan has failed, that the current economic approach has failed and that Canada needs a new economic initiative. The country needs stimulation. The proposal of the Liberal Party of Canada, as articulated by the leader of the party, now needs to be given a chance.
We asked for a municipal infrastructure program. We asked for a program that would see one-third funding by the federal government, by the provincial governments and by the municipal governments. We asked that the multibillions of dollars of work that is out there waiting to be done and needs to be done, which represents an investment in the country, a retooling of our infrastructure, rebuilding the bridges, the roads, the water and sewer systems, the municipal infrastructure, that it be taken on and people be put back to work investing substantially in our future. We were not talking about painting the graveyard fence for the third time, we were talking about rebuilding the infrastructure of this country.
We ask again that that proposal be looked at. The Federation of Municipalities of Canada which originated that proposal will be meeting soon in Montreal. The mayors of all the great cities all across this country will be coming together. Once again, I expect they will be asking the government to look at that proposal to get this country working.
It is not hard to understand why the mayors are saying that. Look across the country. In St. John's, Newfoundland unemployment is 16.8 per cent; in Saint John, 12.6 per cent; in Sherbrooke, 12 per cent. In Oshawa, in southern Ontario, the heart of the manufacturing centre of this country, 11 per cent of the people are unemployed; St. Catharines, 10 per cent; Windsor, 11.6 per cent; Winnipeg, the riding of my friend and colleague, 11.7 per cent. In great Edmonton where every person from Cape Breton to Newfoundland went to find a job

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
when all else went wrong, unemployment is nearly 12 per cent. In Victoria, unemployment is 8.6 per cent.
This Prime Minister promised when he took power that he would change the face of Canada. Yes, Mr. Speaker, he has succeeded, he has changed the face of this country. It is a battered face, it is a bruised face, it is a shameful face, it is a face of a people who have lost their dignity and their hopes for a prosperous future. That is what this Prime Minister has done.
Canadians are telling this government, and certainly we on this side are telling this government, either face up to the reality of our circumstance, provide us with a realistic economic program, assist us, assist the municipalities and assist the provinces in getting this economy going, or move aside.
It should move aside because no government with just 11 or 12 per cent of the support of the people, not for a month or not as a consequence of a particularly bad political policy or a faux pas by the Prime Minister or a faux pas by the Minister of Finance but a government that has been sustained at 12, 13 or 14 per cent for a year has to ask itself whether or not it is fundamentally out of step with both the aspirations and the reality of the majority of Canadians.
This government is out of step. This government is dangerous to national unity. This government has brought this country to the edge of crisis. This government has to get with it and bring forward a realistic program.
If members opposite have one shred of compassion and belief in their country, if for one moment in their existence as politicians they can see beyond their partisan positions and see the position of the country for what it is, this government has to vacate office. It has to move aside. It has to call an election. It has to give the people of Canada a chance to elect a new administration of whatever stripe, of whatever make-up, to give this country a chance to work again.
In closing, may I say that if there is only one of that raggedy lot across the way who is maintained here as a voice of conscience for his people, I hope, Mr. Speaker, that it is you. Because when the fire storm comes, not many on that side are going to survive, and with good reason.

I want to ask him a question based on what he said a few moments ago about our rising today for a period of two weeks. I would like to put this question on the record. I want to ask the hon. member-and this should be something for the government to think about and the Canadian people to think about for the next two weeks. Why does the hon. member believe the government has behaved in such a manner?
The official statistics show that there has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of people who filed income tax returns in Canada earning between $100,000 and $125,000 a year who have non-taxable returns filed. Why is there an increase of some 40 per cent in the people who earn between $125,000 and $150,000 a year who filed income tax returns in Canada but do not pay one penny of income tax; a 40 per cent increase if they make between $150,000 and $200,000; a 30 per cent increase if they make between $200,000 and $250,000?
Here is the key one. If they make over $250,000 a year in Canada, why does the hon. member think that the Government of Canada made changes in our tax system? The official statistics from Ihxation Canada show a 30 per cent increase in the number of people making over $250,000 a year who filed income tax returns in this country last year and the year before who do not pay one penny of income tax.
I want to ask him why he thinks the government turned around three months ago, changed the law relating to trusts in Canada to allow them an increase for 30 years for all of those deferred capital gains taxes since 1972 owed by our biggest corporations and by our 20 or so billionaires in Canada. Why has that been deferred now for another 30 years?
Why did the government change the law relating to what very wealthy people can claim as entertainment and it places now as a limit in the Criminal Code of Canada that one can claim anything as long as it does not violate the Criminal Code of Canada, an 80 per cent deduction on the income tax returns of the wealthiest people in Canada?

I could not pretend to rationalize or to give any rational, sane, reasonable, understandable or communicable reason that could be retained, examined and turned around in the light of day and found to be a solid reason that this government would do such a dastardly thing. Perhaps it is because it believes it has given such a large tax break in the February 25 budget to Canada's poor.
We have to be fair. My friend from Gander-Grand Falls would want to be fair. The government did give- he will recall we discussed it-a $2 a year tax break to a family of four with an income of $15,000. That is $2 a year, less than one penny a day, but it is $2 a year. The government did give a $7 a year tax break to a family of four with an income of $30,000. We must be fair and acknowledge that. It did give senior citizens just a few weeks ago a great big increase for this year, 37 cents a month.
We know the poor people of Canada are getting their share. It is only reasonable that if the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and the privileged corporate few are getting their multi-tens of thousands of dollars tax break, that senior citizens should get their 37 cents a month, that a family of four with an income of $15,000 should get their $2 a year.

The hon. member has reminded me that the minister of fisheries, the member for St. John's West, a member of this cabinet, wants to practise the words of the premier of Newfoundland, so they say, ""fairness and balance, a reasonable and just and proper approach to the expenditure of public funds"". That is the bill we are debating today, Bill C-56. That is proper and reasonable expenditure of public funds.
The minister of fisheries for Newfoundland and Labrador, the minister of all the fishermen of Newfoundland and Labrador, 95 per cent of whom are not in the minister's riding, that minister of fisheries, the member for St. John's West, according to the estimates tabled in this House spent 70 per cent-seven zero-70 per cent of all the small craft harbours' budget for Newfoundland and Labrador in one constituency, the constituency of the member for St. John's West.
How can the hard-working fishermen who have a tough time making a living against the backdrop of foreign overfishing, who cling by their fingernails to the rocks on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, scraping out and harvesting a living from the sea expect fairness when the minister of fisheries spends 70 per cent of the entire

Lloyd Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I rise with some trepidation to join this holy trinity of Newfoundland members who have just in vivid and colourful language expressed the lament that all Canadians must feel on this black Friday for the plight of our nation and the sorrowful condition of so many Canadians.
I looked at the figures this morning to see in my own city of Winnipeg an unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent, up 20 per cent over last year. There are over 40,000 individuals unemployed in that one city alone.
I did not have to read the figures this morning to know what the situation was. I only had to visit high schools in my own constituency which had to put food banks in the schools themselves. We have now added a new form of curricular activity in the high schools of Winnipeg which is food banks to feed hungry students.
I did not have to read the figures to see that there are over 50,000 people on welfare, an increase of 25 per cent. Again, in my own constituency, I found that there was a two and a half year waiting list for people who have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits to get into the training program.
I cannot ever forget the gall and blatant hypocrisy of a minister of employment who stood up in this House when asked these decent questions about what he is going to do for these people and said: ""Don't worry, we are spending more money on training than we ever spent before,"" if you happen to be on the unemployment insurance roll.
What happens when you have 200,000, 300,000, or 400,000 Canadians who have exhausted their benefits and have nowhere to go? They do not get included in the calculations of that minister.
If you are a young person coming out of school and looking for your first job, you are not eligible for a training program. You have to wait for two or two and a half years. If you are a woman who wants to come into the work force to help support the family, a single parent mother, you do not get in the training program. You are on the waiting list.
April 10, 1992

By the way, officials in that riding have said: ""We do not even take applications any more. We have given up. We do not even take names for the list because there is no point. Why let people go for frustration?""
Perhaps the argument is best summed up this way. At a meeting in my riding last night they said that recession is when your neighbour loses his job and depression is when you lose your job. Recovery is when this government loses its job.
That is going to be the only answer that Canadians are going to ask for. They understand that there is a bankruptcy, a total and complete failure of commitment, engagement or understanding about dealing with the plight of the unemployed in this country.
The government simply does not care any more. It will bring in a budget that totally ignores the economic reality of a country that is haemorrhaging in its loss of jobs and in fact aids and abets that loss of jobs.
I want to tell a little story. On Monday, I raised a question in this House of Commons to the external affairs minister asking why CIDA was giving a contract to an American firm to build steel grain bins which could be built by any number of firms in western Canada.
Now, I want you to listen to this carefully, Mr. Speaker, because you are a loyal son of the west. The minister wrote me a letter and with great clarity responded by saying that the reason we gave the contract to the Americans in Nebraska is because the costs were 30 per cent lower.
I showed the letter to the steel manufacturers in Canada. They did some comparison figures, and they recognized immediately what was happening was that the American firm was dumping its product into Canada.
So we have the incredible circumstance of a Canadian governmental agency using Canadian taxpayers' money, aiding and abetting an American firm to engage in an unfair trade practice by dumping its product below price in our country and taking away the jobs of Canadians while doing it.
And yet we have a government that is complacent, indifferent and could not care less. To top it all off, we
Government Orders
then have the minister of trade getting up and saying: ""I am going to spend millions of dollars to tell Canadians about our success stories"".
I suppose the number one success story in that glossy, multicoloured brochure will be how that firm in Nebraska took jobs away from Winnipeg because the Government of Canada procured products from them rather than from Canadians. I suppose that is the number one success story on which we are going to be spending Canadian government money to tell us how the system is working.
It is no wonder that we are facing 11 per cent unemployment when we have a government which does not even understand how to use its own resources, its own procurement, its own contracting, to give Canadians a helping hand.
To repeat and paraphrase the words of my good friend from Newfoundland, who in his own way paraphrased the words of Cromwell, you have done enough damage, it is time for you to go.
There are opportunities, there are initiatives. I look back into the historical record just to give one example. Back in 1983 when there was also a recession-we do not in any way try to cover the fact that there was high unemployment-but let me give you a contrast as to what was done at that time.
We used to have the NEED program, the New Employment Expansion and Development program. We put up $200 million, which was matched dollar for dollar by the municipalities, the provinces, the private sector and we put close to 60,000 people who had exhausted their UI benefits back into the work force. Tories across the way like to say that make-work projects do not work, but I will tell you how it worked.
Today in the city of Sudbury, the hills are blossoming with trees and grass because we put people to work on an environmental program to restore the environmental ecological fabric of that city.
In Thompson, Manitoba when the entire nickel mine went down the tubes for a full year we put 2,000 or 3,000 workers back to work fixing up the infrastructure of that city.

April 10, 1992
My good friend from Cape Breton is here. He knows full well that under that program we were able to build sewage and water treatment plants in his municipality.
Is that a waste of money? We just had a report from the Minister of the Environment yesterday which said: ""My God, we have dirty, poisonous water in Canada, but we can't do anything about it"". Well, we were doing something about it. We were putting unemployed people back to work to save the environment. That is what we were doing.

I met last weekend with families who are among the hundreds of people who have not yet had any form of compensation. It is no good for the government to talk about the $584 million or to talk about the $57 million in compensation for the two previous years, as it always does, if these 100 families cannot get their hands on any of it.
I am going to appeal to the compassion of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans for his fellow Newfoundlanders who have been severely hurt by this tragic turn of events in the north Atlantic fisheries.
When can I expect a straightforward reply that yes, there is a minister for Newfoundland who cares and that compensation will be forthcoming while there is still some dignity and hope remaining.

Lead, PCBs, pesticides and other contaminants are found in the air,
water, soils and wildlife of the region, carried by winds high in the

What is the government doing about this? It says action is underway to accurately determine the sources of the contaminants. We know where the contaminants are coming from. It is not time for more studies, it is time for action.

April 10, 1992

(1)	That 43 per cent of the survey respondents claimed that the motivation of their last same-day shopping trip was for specific purposes, like the purchase of gasoline or milk;
(2)	That 68 per cent of those surveyed said that if gasoline was comparable in price with that in the U.S. they would not cross-border shop.
In light of these findings, all governments must consider the fact that the current level of taxation on gasoline, both federal and provincial, represents some 85 per cent of the price differential of gasoline.
Together gasoline taxes constitute 40 per cent of the retail price. In this case taxation is making us uncompetitive. I think the federal government must entertain and examine innovative proposals which would seek to address this tax-induced competitive inequity.

Whatever the acting minister chooses to say about what Canadians do or do not understand, Canadians who are unemployed, their families and the communities they live in understand very well the devastating effects of this government's economic policies. Every day they get worse and today's over 11 per cent unemployment rate just confirms that not only is the budget a failure, the government is also a failure and it must take action now.
As families are being devastated, as communities are being devastated, how many more jobs lost, how many more families hurt, how many more communities devastated before this government will take some action?

The budget enunciates a number of them. I will repeat them for her just to refresh her memory. There are personal income tax cuts. There is a home buyers purchase plan which, by the way, has spurred the housing industry on. There are increasing home starts. There are increasing sales in homes. This is very encouraging. It is one of the industries that will help lead us out of these difficult economic times.
We have put in place adjustments to the manufacturing and processing industry. The industries have been hard hit during this recession and we have done something in the budget to help them.
The hon. member knows that these things do not happen overnight. For her to make the statement that because things do not happen in one month after the budget it is a failure, is totally incorrect.

It has taken since 1984 for this government to destroy the Canadian economy, destroy Canadian jobs, and devastate Canadian communities.

Madam Speaker, 76,000 jobs were lost in a single month. In Montreal, over 200,000 people are unemployed and 100,000 are on welfare. This means that poverty in Montreal is costing the country $600 million annually. And the minister still has the nerve to say things are getting better? Has the government no shame?
Something has to be done now to bring down the unemployment rate and create jobs. What does the government intend to do, not in two years but now, for Canada's unemployed?

I want to refer to a couple of points she said in her preamble that were incorrect. I do not think this minister or any minister in our government said that things were going well. We are going through a tough period of time as are other countries. We are all going through a tough period of time, but we have basics in place. All indicators, commissions and groups indicate that Canada is in the best position to come out of these difficult times, and that is what we are doing.
I repeat there are a number of items in the budget to help the economy go on. I might remind the hon. member who says that this government has led Canada to a tough economic situation that we had the fastest growth and job creation over a seven-year period of any OECD country. So what she says is totally wrong.

That is the result, the direct result of this government's high interest policies, the high dollar, and the Canada-
U.S. trade deal.
The minister mentioned earlier in his response to another question that the Canadian Jobs Strategy and training programs needed to be changed. The change that this government has made has been to cut the Canadian Jobs Strategy for the last number of years, $100 million in the last budget. This has had devastating

consequences for the employment equity programs of the Canadian Jobs Strategy.
This is reflected today in Canada's statistics when we see that women over 25 are the most adversely affected by these unemployment statistics and are followed very closely by the young people in our country who are also suffering because of unemployment.
It is clear this government's policies have created this situation. If the government is not willing to make things better, will the government at least stop making things worse?

The hon. member said that we have a high interest rate policy. It turns out we have the lowest interest rates we have had in this country in 20 years. The dollar is some five cents lower than it was a year ago and that has helped with exports.
Our trade has grown since the free trade agreement with the United States. Our trade surplus with the United States has grown. There are some things happening in the economy that are very good. It will take time to come out of this, but we are in a position to do it. We are confident that as this year wears on we will find that economic conditions will improve and employment will improve.

Canada is experiencing a massive and alarming one-month jump in the unemployment rate in this country and this government's response, specifically this minister's response, is to launch a multimillion dollar advertising campaign to tell the people of Canada the ""good news"" about free trade.
Unemployment in Newfoundland today is 20.3 per cent. In my own riding it is 23.6 per cent.
I want to ask the minister of trade, the minister of propaganda, whether or not he is prepared to cancel the multimillion dollar advertising campaign telling Canadians that things are all right and whether he is prepared to face up to the reality of unemployment in Canada and
to use that money to create jobs in Newfoundland and across this country. People want the dignity of a pay-cheque, not the pablum from a propaganda campaign.

We have taken a number of actions to deal with the unemployment problem.
In addition, we know that people are aware of success stories, people who are finding new markets and building new markets in other countries. What we want to do with this advertising program is to convey to Canadians that there are people who are achieving success. If that can motivate others to do the same sort of thing then they will create jobs as well.
Are we going to sit in this House of Commons and only talk about the negatives that are happening in the country and not about the fact that some statistics are moving in the right direction? Inflation is at 1.7 per cent, the real gross domestic product in January was up, interest rates are down to their lowest levels in many years, and the Canadian merchandise trade balance has increased steadily month by month since September. These are all positive elements which must be taken into account.
If all we talk about is the negative then everybody will think negative things and will not see the progress my hon. friend would like to see and we on this side of the House would like to see.

I plead with the minister, in the name of 11 per cent of the population who are unemployed.

The economic circumstances today are better than they were in 1981-82, so my friend is misleading people when he says things are far, far worse.
He talked about the phoney program. What we are trying to achieve is to let Canadians know that there are successes. I have talked to people who are building business in other countries. They are building business in the United States. SR Telecom is a company that has grown from $2 million in sales about 10 years ago to $48 million in sales today.
Do people not want to understand that there are those successes in this country? Do people not want to understand how it is that SR Telecom built that business in that period of time?
Maybe there are ways that other companies in Canada can follow that success, can be motivated by that success, can emulate that success and create jobs here in Canada.

A lot of the unemployment problems we have now are because young people do not have the education. The premier of British Columbia pointed out very clearly not too long ago that there were 300,000 high-tech jobs available in this country going unfilled because we had not trained our young people to take those jobs.

The fact of the matter is that the government's policies are not working. The minister has said that they have taken action. Yes, but that action is wrong. It is not working.

It will do something else besides simply create jobs in the short term. It will also put the companies in a position where they will be able to compete in the long term. That will allow them to maintain those jobs.

I began to speak on this bill just before Question Period. I am glad in a way that we had that opportunity to have an exchange with government ministers about the tragic and terrible events as reported today by Statistics Canada in terms of the unemployment figures. There was no clearer evidence of just how strong and serious is the need and how inadequate and ineffectual is the response.
It is hard to believe that when the government is presented with the evidence of increases in unemployment of 20 per cent, of young people not being able to get jobs, of the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits, the only response we hear from the Minister of State for Finance is: ""Well, I think our forecast was right"".
The hon. gentleman shows as much empathy as an Arctic ice-floe. He has no understanding of what it means to be unemployed. He will soon find out. As soon as the election is called he will have the full experience and maybe it will change his mind.
Equally, it is hard to believe that the Minister for International Trade, a former Minister of Finance, would have the gall, the unmitigated nerve to stand in this House and defend a government policy of advertising so-called success stories for millions of dollars and refuse to concede that it might be more important to

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
create a few more success stories for individual Canadians who are unemployed.
There is not a more obvious example of waste than a government that is churning up the printing presses, going to some high-powered friends in the ad agencies, buying lots of time on CTV, Global, or whatever, while it is ignoring young people, single mothers, people who have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits, fishermen, and others. It covers a wide spectrum.
It is an admission of enormous gross failure and a hardening of the arteries when it comes to the responsibility of a government to create employment.
Allow me to use this opportunity to clarify two points. When I asked the Minister for International Trade why a government agency was authorizing the purchase of U.S. products in violation of Canadian trade law he said that his colleague from Provencher, the minister of energy, told him that this was a misleading statement.
I want to show the House just how misleading it is. This is a letter from the general manager of Westeel. He said:
The grain storage industry members in Canada-would request that Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise Branch immediately bring into effect an anti-dumping and countervail action against CIDA and Central Canadian Structures, Winnipeg, importers of record on this transaction.
Is it misleading when the industry itself is asking for it? The minister, in an attempt to once again camouflage and hide the truth says: ""Well, that is misleading"", as if that should be taken as gospel.
Is it not amazing that a minister of industry, whose primary function is to defend the interests of Canadian manufacturers, whose sworn oath of office is to act on their behalf, is prepared to contravene and tolerate a contravention of our own trade laws, seriously hurting our own manufacturers? For the sake of what?
Does he really have deep concern for a manufacturing plant in Nebraska? What is he afraid of, what is he covering up? I do not understand the logic. It would have been so obvious, so easy for the minister to get up and say: ""Here is a serious problem, I am going to look into it"". That is what ministers are for. We have a House of
Commons to respond to these kinds of events. That is the definition of accountability. However, instead he tries to defend the indefensible.
Let me point out another attempt to camouflage, to smoke-screen the realities. When this side of the House importuned, made requests, presented ideas, and submitted proposals-municipal infrastructure program, increased training for those who are not eligible under the UI system-the response of both ministers in Question Period was: ""Oh, those are make-work projects. They don't work. We don't want to throw our money away on getting people to work"".
Which is worse? Is it worse than having people on welfare, paying for their upkeep through transfer payments and CAP, having them stay at home, unused, not paying taxes, going through the emotional stress affecting their families?
One of the primary symptoms of the condition affecting this country is the number of high school students absent or late for school. Sometimes the reason is that they are the only wage-earner in their family.
They can and must get a short-term service job at a hamburger stand or as a gas jockey because their father or mother no longer has a permanent job, no longer can go to work. If you talk to the schools in Winnipeg, which I have done, you are told that it is an increasing problem. Kids miss school in the mornings or leave early in the afternoons to go to work because they are the only wage-earner in the family. Yet, we have a government that says it would rather have people on welfare than going to work.
What incredible perverse logic. What an incredible indictment of the kind of thinking that seems to be rattling around inside the Cabinet chambers, if you can dare to call it thinking at all.
Yet, it is not a question of people painting fences or raking leaves, all those old mythologies that Tories like to use. I have given examples under the NEED program in which we had people building municipal sewers to get rid of waste. This is a government that presented a report yesterday saying: ""What is one of the great problems in Canada? It is dirty water, undrinkable water, pollution, environmental degradation"".
April 10, 1992

What would happen if in co-operation with the municipalities, the provinces and private industry we were able to offer 100,000 Canadians or so the opportunity to begin investing in the clean-up of the environment, saving money by the way? Ultimately, pollution costs. There is a cost to dirty water, there is a cost to dirty air.
Yet, this government does not seem able to understand that there is a lot of worth-while important work out there to be done. This is a government that refuses to heed the call.
At the same time, with the most arrogance I have heard, it will say: ""But we are prepared to pay millions of dollars for advertising to tell about the success stories"". Is that not incredible?
People come here saying that they want to work and municipalities put propositions on the table. Yet, what do we get? We get $25 million for a productivity study. How many more millions for the Mike Wilson success story, which begins in that steel fabrication plant in Nebraska that just got more work because of the Canadian government? A great success story.
It is hard to explain to people back in the constituency how on the one hand they can see the need, feel the pain, know the hurt and at the same time they will tune in to a Minister for International Trade who says: ""My major initiative this week is to get more camouflage out on the airwaves"".
Is it any wonder that there is cynicism out there? People want government to work for them. People understand it is only government that can fill in the gaps at times. There are things that the marketplace cannot do and God knows we have so many tasks that need to be done that go unfilled.
It may just come down to this ideological blindness that says government cannot do anything worth while. The evidence contradicts that. There are important, good, effective, constructive things that government can do. It does have to do it by itself.
Work can be created through the private sector, with stimulus and changing the interest rate policy, investing in infrastructure, putting serious training programs in
Government Orders
place. That is investment, it is not make-work, and it is only the public sector that can provide it.
Why do we tolerate 1.6 million Canadians unemployed when there is plenty of work to do? All we have to do is have a government that is prepared to go to work for those Canadians.

Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grace):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for his very forceful speech on a disastrous problem for this whole country.
During Question Period I brought to the attention of the government the fact that during the month of March, Canada lost 56,000 full-time jobs. Of those, 45,000 were held by women. In other words, out of those 56,000 full-time jobs that were lost last month, 45,000 were lost by women. That was the fifth consecutive month of recording losses in full-time jobs.
In addition, I looked at the labour force survey that came out today and it has added a new figure that was not there before. It has brought to our attention what is called ""discouraged workers"". These are workers who are not counted in the unemployment figures because they have given up looking for work. They have tried and tried, but then they finally gave up. Therefore, they are not counted among the 11.1 per cent, the 1.5 million Canadians out of work. But they are estimated in this new supplement to the survey as being approximately 99,000, another 99,000 not even counted in the unemployment figures. They are out of work but have given up looking.
When we asked the government today about these terrible statistics, the minister said: ""The government is taking action"". We know the government is taking action. It is mostly action to get out of programs, to cut unemployment insurance, cut training programs, put a cap on the Canada Assistance Plan, not get involved in a massive infrastructure program. It has a philosophy more or less that the free market will fix everything.
Earlier in the member's speech he referred to what we did when we were in government in 1982-83 when we were faced with a recession. We believed, unlike this government, that a government must take action and it intervened with the private sector and with the provinces to do something.

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
By the way, if we look at Canada, the greatest years of prosperity in this country have been at times when there was a partnership of the government, the private sector and the provinces.
I want to ask the member if he would expand a bit on the NEED program. He referred to the NEED program and the other programs that we used to start the economy rolling again at the time of the recession in 1981-1982, unlike this government which is quite content to sit back and let things happen.
Yes, it is taking action but it is action to get out of things, rather than action to stimulate the economy and put people back to work.
I wonder if he could expand a bit on a different philosophy, a Liberal philosophy, which is co-operation, participation by the government with the private sector in getting the economy rolling again.

3904985,ca.proc.d.1992-04-10.4.1.1.5,1992-04-10,19dd9722-bc3e-4711-ac9e-913b7fd56106,ca.m.5724,Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to put on the record the kinds of things that a caring government is interested in doing. If I might, I would make one comment in response to the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grace about what we are discovering today. It is not just unemployment that is the problem, it is also a question of equity that is a problem.
But those who are suffering the most are clearly those who are most vulnerable. The progress we have attempted to make in this country over the years in ensuring equal treatment in the work place between men and women, of providing more equal treatment for disadvantaged Canadians, disabled Canadians, is one that is also suffering as a result.
What bothers me most is this continual attempt to evade responsibility. Today we heard once again another example of the great lie where a government minister said: ""We are putting more money into training"".
The only increases that are going into training programs are paid for under the Unemployment Insurance Act which is not public money. It is money contributed only by employers and employees. The government is not contributing any new money. It is only drawn out of the unemployment insurance fund which means the only people eligible for training are those who can draw UI.
What happens when you exhaust your UI benefits? You are no longer eligible for training. What happens if you are a young person getting out of school? You are
not eligible for training. What happens if you are a single parent who wants to get into the work force but has no work record? You are not eligible for training. That is why there is a two-year training list because training paid for by the government out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund has been cut back successively the last two or three years.
Those are the facts. Those are the honest facts. For the government to keep saying that it has increased dollars for training is not being honest with Canadians.
In terms of the kinds of things that can be done, let me give an example because I think maybe government members ought to know. I am sure they have unemployed people in their ridings.
In 1982 when the previous government announced the new employment expansion development program, by the end of that year, in one year's time, it had spent $189 million federally which was matched by $71 million provincially and $91 million from the private sector.
We had a direct one to one ratio of contributions which means it had a multiplied effect. We put 35,000 people back into the work force using the programs as a trampoline. In addition to that, and I think the hon. member would know because he was an active proponent of the program, we had a special program for the employment disadvantaged, people who had a hard time getting work, those who were disabled, those who had been out of the work force for a long time, mothers who had only one child.
Again we were able to put several thousand back into the work force. It was a program that was shared with the private sector. We would pay part of the wage and the private sector would pay part of it. What is important is that many of the people who were brought into that program stayed working for the same employer after the program was over.
It is a total contradiction to the evidence that was provided today by ministers. They make up these things. They fabricate them in their own minds. They have their own bubble factory where they sort of swallow their own mystique. But that is the reality.
I am not saying that is all you do but there is a direct responsibility by the federal government to work in a co-operative fashion with other levels of government and the private sector to put people back to work and that in itself will provide the stimulus to get the economy going again.
April 10, 1992

If people are working, then people are consuming. If people are consuming, then they start helping other people go back to work. That is why we came out of the recession in 1983-84, because we had a government that was prepared to invest.

3904986,ca.proc.d.1992-04-10.4.1.1.6,1992-04-10,e7ce06f9-85e6-4a9d-8c01-94b3de52a6cb,ca.m.5850,Mr. Jack Whittaker (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I look at the legislation before us today, Bill C-56, an act respecting the control of government expenditures and I cannot help but think that the government, once again, is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of Canadian people as it has with its debt reduction and servicing act, telling them one thing and doing another.
I know this bill is very important to the members of the government because they have filled the government benches today and are here waiting breathlessly for my comments on this bill.
I want to tell those members of the government that they will not accomplish what they have tried with this bill. They will not pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Canada by getting them to believe that they are serious about putting a cap or control on government expenditures, or for that matter, reducing or servicing the debt and the deficit of this country.
The very fact that they set out hollow words in statutes does not add to the credibility of this government. In fact, by doing that, I believe that they have increased the skepticism of the people of Canada.
The ordinary citizens in Canada, while perhaps not always totally up on what is in these various bills, are still well aware of the over-all thrust of what is going on here. They have watched very closely and very carefully since 1984 what this government has done. The fiscal policies, the monetary policies that have proven so disastrous in this country as shown today by the StatsCan labour force information shows that the unemployment rate is up across Canada to 11.1 per cent.
In my area in the Okanagan, there is well over 13 per cent unemployment. As Mr. Speaker knows, the Okana-
Govemment Orders
gan is known for its warmth, its sunshine. We have had blossoms out over the last two or three weeks.
Unfortunately on Monday we were hit by frost. That is going to be devastating. Three straight days of heavy frost will be devastating to the orchard industry in the Okanagan and Similkameen regions and will cause higher unemployment throughout my area. Where we have people coming from all across Canada during the summer to pick the fruit, it will cause further hardship.
What have we got from this government? We have more hollow, more empty words set out in Bill C-56. What is in this bill?
The government has set out spending limits under the definitions section over the following five years, stating that during the 1991-92 fiscal year, the spending limit will be $97.2 billion.
The following year it is $100.9 billion, followed by $104.1 billion for 1993-94. In 1994-95, it is $107.4 billion and in the final year, 1995-96, it is up to $111.25 billion plus the amounts by which the spending limit for the year has increased under the various other subsections.
As members can see by that, it is not control as such. It is setting out within this bill limits that on the increases in the deficit and government spending. I know, since I have been in this House since 1988. It is very apparent. I have read each of the budgets as they have come out in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. In each case I have watched. The first year as a new member of Parliament I thought the government was really going to get the deficit under control and spending under control. By the end of the year, in the public accounts the following year I found that the deficit had increased even though it said it was going to decrease.
The government has set out this wonderful plan each year for how much the deficit was going to decrease and how it was going to get the government expenditures under control. If we go back to the first year, the deficit was supposed to be down to about $25 billion. In fact it

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
tells us that it was $30.5 billion, somewhere in the same region where it was when I first came here in 1988.
It has not changed all that much since 1984 when this government was brought into power. What is happening? I think that they are misguided. Government members are misguided in both their fiscal monetary policies and in their over-all thrust of where they are going. We see in the budget cutbacks of $100 million in the Canadian Jobs Strategy, a program that has been used well in Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. It has been used well in Alberta, in your riding, Mr. Speaker, and throughout Canada. It is an area we have looked at and enjoyed as a method of retraining and as a method of ensuring people are allowed to go back into the work force.
When we look at the unemployment results this morning, we see that 1.525 million Canadians are out of work. Depression, not recession, is what we have. Increasing unemployment means fewer dollars for people to spend. It means more people out of the work force who pay fewer taxes. It means more expenditures for governments as they try to shore up the economy. It means more people who have given up, women and men who have given up even looking for a job in the job market.
It means people who have run out of unemployment insurance, who have been a year, a year and a half, two years, three years without a job and without hopes of ever getting a job. They have simply given up. They are now on social assistance, on the welfare rolls, and where does this cost roll to? It rolls back to the taxpayer. It is part of the non-productive sector we have to pay out to ensure that people are allowed to live in some dignity.
Most people do not want to be on social assistance. They will do anything to get a job. They feel very depressed and despondent at having to stay at home. It causes problems within the family if the husband or wife is unemployed. They feel they are not worth anything. They are not able to find jobs. Very often they are not even able to get job interviews.
These people want some hope. They are not going to get hope out of Bill C-56. What they want is job creation. They want some of that $8 million the government is putting in advertising put into municipal infrastructure or construction, the creation of jobs.
The Minister of State for Small Businesses and Tourism would like some of the money put into his area so that he can develop his programs. He has worked hard. He knows the backbone of the Canadian economy is the small business sector. They are without hope, without some of these programs. Only we in this Parliament and only they as government can offer some hope to those who might get into small business, to those who might create a starting position of one, two, three, four and perhaps a hundred new jobs within communities like Oliver, Osoyoos, Penticton, Grand Forks, and other places in my riding that have high unemployment rates.
Programs like Community Futures and Western Diversification are excellent programs that offer some hope. People look with such cynicism upon a government that says it is going to spend $8 million in telling people about the successes of the free trade agreement.
I have heard various ministers on the government side speak in favour of the free trade agreement and the North American free trade agreement.
What has the FTA done? It has devastated the manufacturing sector throughout Canada. I think that is shown in the commentary on unemployment figures wherein it states as follows: ""The estimates for Statistics Canada labour force survey for March 1992 show a sharp rise in the seasonally adjusted level of unemployment and a substantial decline in employment. Following little change in the last quarter of 1991, the unemployment rate has increased since January and rose 11.1 per cent in March from 10.6 per cent in February, continuing the trend of recent months. There were losses in both full-time employment and employment in manufacturing"".
I think that says a lot. Perhaps that says it all. What we have seen under the free trade agreement is the devastation of our manufacturing sector. We have seen jobs that have gone south both to the United States and to Mexico. We have seen an increase, as we have perhaps seen in this report, in the service sector industry, an industry which normally pays fairly low wages, not the high wages of the manufacturing sector.
Is that what is becoming of Canada? Are we to be a service-based industry for the United States, for Mexico, for the rest of the world?
April 10, 1992

Government Orders
That is not good enough for the Canadian people and it is certainly not good enough for me. We have to take initiative. We have to ensure that our raw resources are produced in Canada, that we have from those raw resources value added production in our mineral industry, our softwood lumber industry, and our agricultural industry.
For too long we have turned our back on research and development. For too long we have turned our back on ensuring that those industries are developed for jobs for Canadians. That is where we have to turn to give some hope to those unemployed people, those 1.525 million Canadians who are presently out of work.
Later this month or next month I will specifically have a motion before this House dealing with value added production and the necessity for Canadians and the Canadian government to have a buy Canada policy.
If this government had a buy Canada policy, can we imagine the number of jobs that could be produced in this country, the number of people who could be off those unemployment rolls?
The number of institutions controlled by this federal government is enormous. The number of areas within Canada supplied by contract suppliers who buy out of the country is massive. If we could convince those people who bid on our Canadian institution contracts both federally and provincially, I firmly believe we could have that employment base. We could have the encouragement for our small business sector. We could have the encouragement for our manufacturing sector in all these resource areas, in the value added areas of our resource areas to produce the employment, to create jobs here in Canada.
I look at this sham of a bill and the sham of the debt reduction and servicing act. According to the polls people say they want the deficit reduced and they want our national debt under control.
The government set up a bill to have people believe that it was going to do something to control the deficit and debt when in fact it can overspend. By the minister's own statement he said this bill can be amended.
If government members in fact had a commitment to get their debt under control and to get the deficit under control, they would not need the words in this statute. They would not need the debt reduction and servicing act, which is a sham, an attempt to fool the Canadian people. They would show us by their actions that they had the ability to manage the economy of this country and to manage the expenditures of the Government of Canada. They do not. They have proven that. They talked about managing change.
The change I have seen since November 1988 when I came to this House is higher unemployment. The free trade agreement has led to the flood of jobs to the south and the dissolving of the manufacturing sector.
I have essentially seen the Unemployment Insurance Act gutted and the benefit periods shortened. I have watched the gutting of the universality of family allowances, the threat of the gutting of universality to old age security with the clawback. I listened to a minister announce the end of universality in Canada.
I fear that it will also lead to the end of universality in our medical program. When I hear the Minister of National Health and Welfare talk about the sacred trust, those words come back to me. I remember hearing in the 1988 election about our sacred trust in social programs.
We have seen what this government thinks about that sacred trust and how hollow those words are, as are the words in these particular statutes.
It is interesting to look at some of the comments of those before the committee studying these. The recommendations of the committee included the following: ""Any legislated reduction in total tax revenues which causes the federal government's fiscal targets not to be met must be accompanied by measures offsetting this decrease (in revenues) through other forms of revenue increase or expenditure reduction. Revenue increases, however, may take place that have the effect of reducing the deficit"".
Government members did not pay any attention to those recommendations of the committee. Most witnesses who appeared before the committee agreed that there had to be some control on government spending, but very few of those witnesses attempted to articulate just why legislation was needed to achieve spending

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
control. I would suggest, as I have said earlier, that they should be showing the leadership as opposed to putting down in legislation what they think people want to hear.
Professor Douglas Hartle from the University of Toronto recognized the need for spending restraint but viewed the control program as little more than a public relations exercise. He concluded that the federal government forecasts of future deficits are contingent upon declining interest rates more so than programs spending control.
Further, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business stated: ""Within the current dismal economic and fiscal circumstances, small business owners and Canadians generally have lost confidence in the government's ability to manage its own affairs, let alone manage the country"".
This bill is a sham. It is a public relations opportunity for government members. They should put their money where their mouths are and show us through action rather than this type of legislation which can be changed at any time that they in fact mean business. They have not convinced me. I am sure they have not convinced the Canadian people. I cannot support a bill that is a sham, a public relations exercise. This bill should be defeated.

Tom Hockin (Minister of State (Small Businesses and Tourism)):,Minister of State (Small Businesses and Tourism),GOVERNMENT ORDERS,SPENDING CONTROL ACT,MEASURE TO ENACT,"Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask my hon. friend a few questions based on his very interesting speech. It had a somewhat different tone than what we usually get from his party, especially in his opening 15 minutes when he talked about the deficit and expressed his concern that the decrease in the deficit is not what he would have liked to have seen. I appreciate that emphasis because I know it is a concern that NDP governments have in the provinces as well.
What does trouble me though is that he neglected to say that we have of course decreased the deficit somewhat. But the economy has doubled in size since we were elected. We have twice as big an economy than before. Therefore, the deficit as a proportion of the national economy has dropped from around 8 per cent to about 4 per cent. Nobody says this is a strong accomplishment but it is something he might like to acknowledge. I wanted to ask him about that.
I also wanted to say that in many ways I am glad he was elected in 1988, because he does try to come up with constructive suggestions. But I do not know if I have heard any suggestions from the NDP members on how to cut the deficit. They are always complaining about other things. When we try to cut spending they complain.
The only suggestion from the NDP members is to somehow cut business perks and so on. That is fine. They can suggest those things and they will be analyzed. Besides that, I do not get many other suggestions on how to cut the deficit. I was wondering if he would share with me what he would like to see done further in a concrete way to decrease the deficit.
Finally, I was struck by his comments about universality. Part of the reason for changing the way we deal with that subject is that we did not think it was progressive for the very wealthy to receive the same social benefits as middle-income and low-income Canadians. I would have thought that NDP members would share our views on that. They insist on the very wealthy, someone earning $500,000 or $200,000 a year, getting the same social benefits and medical coverage and so on, as low and medium-income Canadians. How does he justify that, especially coming from a social democratic party? If we could do something on this we could decrease the deficit further.

Certainly his work is appreciated by those people in my riding who have had the benefit of some of the programs under his jurisdiction. I know he is working under some budgetaiy constraints as many other departments are.
He spoke about the expansion in the gross domestic product. It is interesting that the figures I have seen show social program spending has not increased relative to the gross domestic product over the past 16 years. What the government would have us believe is that it is the social program spending that has caused all of the deficit problems. Well, it is not.
He alluded to a number of things about taxation and how to cut back on expenses. I know he listened carefully to my remarks about increasing employment through small business initiatives and through ensuring full employment.
April 10, 1992

As long as we have an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent across Canada, 20 per cent in Newfoundland and variations of that across the country, as long as we have a high unemployment rate, as long as we are not committed to close to a zero unemployment rate, we are going to continue to have a major deficit problem.
We have to get those 1.5 million people who are unemployed off the unemployment insurance roles and back to work. We have to do that by creating employment with value added production and buy Canadian initiatives.
We also have to get the people who have given up looking for work into the mode where they are interested and know they have a chance to get back to work. If we have full employment, or near full employment, we will have a productive Canada. We will have a handle on our deficit problems.
This government's fiscal and monetary policies have been misguided I would suggest. In fact, it has been so intent on keeping the inflation rate down it has forgotten the importance of people.
That is what the New Democratic Party is all about. We care for people. We want people to be employed. Yes, we have indicated that we would like to see the deficit decreased. We have come up with a number of ideas including a look at the Income Tax Act. Instead of, as has happened over the last years, a drop from 34 to 28 per cent for those in the higher income brackets, I suggest that perhaps those should be moved up.
We are one of only two countries in the world that does not have some kind of wealth tax or estate taxes. Those types of things for those in the higher income areas could be looked at, as well as the business lunch and other tax breaks that the business community needs but abuses. The abuses have to be cut out. That could save us millions and millions of dollars.
Yes, we are working hard toward ensuring that this government is accountable to the Canadian people. We are working hard to come up with reasonable ideas, hoping that the government, as it did with our suggestions for a number of years, lowers the interest rates and finally starts realizing the wisdom in that advice after years of our pushing the government.
Government Orders
I told the minister of state three years ago that is what the business community wanted. It wanted the assurance that the interest rates would be lower, that the interest rates would be stable so that they could plan into the future. I am glad that the minister and his fellow cabinet members listened to the other members in the New Democratic Party and myself and started dropping those rates.
If the government would start listening to us now as far as a buy Canada program goes, as far as creation of full employment for Canada, it would find that many of its problems with deficit control would dissolve.

I can understand that having been here at many Easter and Christmas closings, but we do have television.
Quite frankly, I was going to be like most other members and get in and out of this House quickly so we can get back to our constituencies for the Easter break and get some reaction from the people. That is part of the reformed rules and they are very good rules, so that we get out of this incestuous cockpit of a capital of the nation and go back to the real people and get views and reactions from the real people.
It was only Question Period and quite frankly, the response of the Prime Minister to John Major's election victory with tremendous credit to John Major that started to make me want to have a speech. I heard the Prime Minister respond over the CBC this morning on Newsworld and listened to what he had to say and knew that others heard what he had to say. For my former colleagues in the Conservative caucus I hope they start to listen.
I am going to say a few things that will not make me too popular or any more popular certainly with the Prime Minister than I am today. It is related also to this bill under discussion. The bill under discussion is Bill C-56 and it is called an act respecting the control of government expenditures.
I am not going to get into all the things that can be said about government expenditures, where they are good, where they are bad, and what we are doing. It was really the catalyst for my rising now. I say to my hon. friend, the member for Provencher, the hon. Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources that I am glad he is here. Obvious-

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
ly, ministers have to do other things and the Minister for International Trade is not here.
Really what got me this morning in Question Period, along with what I had heard earlier about the Prime Minister's reaction to John Major's victory in England yesterday, and I will try not use too many pejoratives, symbolizes one of the reasons I am standing over here as an independent. It also symbolizes the malaise, the discontent, the skepticism and/or cynicism in the public about the whole political process.
Specifically, on one government expenditure, that is government advertising, we heard it today during Question Period. We had the hon. Minister for International Trade, a good friend of mine, who was trying to answer the fact that there is a $9 million program, part of it buy Canadian. That is interesting, and it is $4 million, but $4 million more for in effect saying: ""Feel good Canadians, because trade is working"".
Then there is another million which is part of a joint program with a private broadcaster to in effect show that things are going pretty well, even though we know without getting into all the statistics that there are a lot of bad things out there.
The point is this in terms of government expenditure. I was a member of a very vigorous, active and I thought principled opposition, as the now minister of trade and commerce was, as the minister of energy and resources was.
We complained until the cows came home at what the then government of the Liberal Party was doing on advertising. It was using taxpayers' money to try to make Canadians feel good because the economic realities were not there to make them feel good.
I just do not understand where the Official Opposition research department is. Certainly, knowing what was coming up with the latest advertising budget, I would have thought the Liberal opposition especially, and obviously the research department of the NDP, because there are some members who were here during the time when we were in opposition. Mr. Speaker, you were here too. They could have got chapter, verse, verbatim, comma, semi-colon and exclamation marks of the then member for Etobicoke-Centre or the then member for Provencher chastising those awful Grits for using taxpayers' money to make people feel good when the realities of the world were making them feel something else.
I do not know if the Liberals or the NDP research department are going to do their homework over the Easter break and really come back and show, without being personal here, what Canadians feel about this place. In effect, we say great things in opposition and then we get into government and we do a flip-flop because we are in government.
I tell you that in the old days before television, instant communications and travel, you could get away with that. But that is part of the malaise of the land. You cannot get away with it today.
We are talking about the most recent advertising situation. I have been sitting here as an independent member, on the opposition side in effect. I have really been surprised that the opposition did not get its act together before when in effect, not just trade now where there is a $9 million expenditure of taxpayers' money involved. Some of it is good, but the $4 million to make you feel good when the facts are that your neighbour, your friend and members of your family are unemployed are the reality is going to be a sham as members have said.
The green plan and the environment are very important, but a budget of $4 million in May 1991 going to $12.5 million now for advertising and PR? That is not control of government expenditure.
Canada is a great country and I hope it stays a great country. But goodness gracious, for the budget of the Canada 125 birthday party to go from $25 million to $30 million before we really get into the 125th year of Canada, mainly for PR and advertising, nothing into the communities is certainly an excess of government expenditure. It does not fit the prescription of Bill C-56 which is control of government expenditure.
We do not have to go back too far in the memory bank of Canadians to realize that the promotion and the advertising of the GST was $9.1 million.
Without getting too personal, but we have had the reply to a question on the Order Paper that the Prime Minister's PR of pictures and brochures for some of his trips has cost the Canadian taxpayer quite a few million dollars. That may be good, too, to a point. I know you have to advertise and have nice brochures, and I do not discount ministers and the Prime Minister being offshore.
April 10, 1992

The point of the matter is that this bill is to control government expenditures. In the four and a half minutes I have talked about this item of advertising I have already reached a figure of over $70 million dollars on advertising, just the type of thing we in opposition said was a waste of taxpayers' money.
That is about all I am going to say about advertising because I am now coming to what really got me going earlier this morning. I think it is time that members of Parliament, Canadians, and especially reporters start to focus on some of the ex cathedra obiter dicta of the Prime Minister, who is a very pleasant, engaging individual and has a personality that is overwhelming in many ways. However, some of his facts and statistics should not be allowed to stand unchallenged, no matter how engaging his personality may be.
Quite frankly, when I was listening to Newsworld this morning talking about the reaction of the Prime Minister to John Major's victory in England last night I thought it was April Fool's Day. I thought it was April 1.1 could not believe the Prime Minister's voice. I have heard blarney from Ireland before. I have heard blarney from Blarney. I guess it is possible to kiss the blarney stone and even have more blarney. In my history as a member of Parliament, with all respect to Charles de Gaulle, President Mitterrand, and many other eminent people from France, I have never heard such blarney from the Republic of France as I heard the Prime Minister express today in reaction to John Major's victory in England last night. He chortled and chuckled.
I can see him making a comment and naturally giving congratulations to the Prime Minister of England, as he should. It was an outstanding victory and thank God it was a good victory. However, for the Prime Minister to take comfort-I wish more government members could see and I hope their constituents will talk to them when they go home over the Easter break. The blinkers on the eyes of the Prime Minister were demonstrated in spades by his reaction to the victory last night when he said that it just shows that polls can change and this is what can happen and that he will be back to lead the government to a third majority victory.
Government Orders
I do not know when the press conference was, it may have been early morning. However, surely to goodness the trance and mesmerization of his power of persuasion in the government caucus will start to unravel. He has to admit that the whole reason the Tories won in England is that they removed a very powerful Prime Minister, a very powerful individual named Margaret Thatcher, who had run her course.
She had stayed to her course. She made some unpopular decisions, and the public said they had enough, as they had said about Winston Churchill after the Second World War, despite the fact that he gave a spirit to England to fight that grand fight.
The Tories in their own wisdom, within their own structure in England, were able to neatly, cleanly, and cruelly get rid of Margaret and put the new man in place.
How the Prime Minister of our country, who was and has been for the last two years the lowest in the polls-which is still accepted by the government members-can take comfort from this is more than I can understand. However, the big problem which again mesmerizes the press, has most of the press fearful and certainly mesmerizes the government caucus is the statement which is not true. He said today, and I heard him say it: ""I have been in this position before. Before the 1984 election we were 17 or 18 per cent down in the polls"".
I know this is sort of intra-party, but it concerns government expenditures and the fact that we must start waking up some people around here in the government and in the government caucus.
In fact, for a year and a half, even before we had a leadership convention in 1983 the opposition led by the right hon. member for Yellowhead was running ahead of the Liberal Party by 10 to 15 per cent and for three months was over 50 per cent ahead of the government party.
In effect the Prime Minister is technically correct. After the leadership convention electing the right hon. member for Vancouver Quadra there was a soft blip in the polls for two months during which the Liberal government for the first time in a year and a half to a year and three-quarters went up a percentage point in

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
the polls. This is always relied upon by the Prime Minister to say: ""Okay fellows, I can come back again"".
Also, the polls say that regardless of the position of the Tories in England before and during the campaign-and it was up and down and neck and neck for awhile and not really ahead very much-the leader of the Tories, Prime Minister John Major, was always running far ahead of the other leaders in that campaign which is certainly not the situation in Canada.
In terms of using Bill C-56 as a means to participate in this debate, I am just hoping, for the sake of the country and the Conservative Party, that the beguiling message of the Prime Minister about polls and his capacity to resurrect himself-I suppose that is proper to talk about since we are getting close to the Easter season, but I do not want to trespass too far because it might get sacrilegious.
However, I think it is time, for the sake of Canada, that government members going back to their ridings shake out the wheat from the chaff and talk to their constituents to determine if whether, in trying to patch this country together and solve some of the serious problems that we have, there should not be something like what happened in England. They should determine whether there should be a change in leadership so that, either through a referendum or an election, there are some new faces around so the public will have a choice and not just give present leaders and parties the kick in the kneecap that is certainly indicated by the polls and has been for about a year and a half.
I know this is drifting away a little from government expenditure. However, government expenditure involves elections and referenda. I could list all the constitutional conferences, the Spicer commission, and the Beaudoin-Dobbie commission. The total is close to $100 million. All those conferences and commissions, and ongoing conferences, together is a situation of government expenditure.
The Prime Minister must look at himself in the mirror and not do the blarney act, which he is excellent at, but look in the mirror and ask: ""Am I part of the problem?"" We should take him at his word that this constitutional question is more important than any leader or any party. If he really believes that, members should go home and get the reaction from their constituents about the Prime
Minister, the Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the NDP.
If this country is really under the threat of dissolution and separation, which many believe, and it is very serious-and I am prepared to admit that the Canada I knew when I came into this Parliament 26 years ago is forever changed regardless of the form of change-why are we not thinking a little ahead, instead of talking in mystery about referenda or saying: ""We will see what we can do with a joint agreement with provincial premiers and if we get a couple of recalcitrant ones we might meet with House leaders to see where we go from here"".
Instead of playing hocus-pocus with members who should be more involved than they are-and I give full credit to the Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs although, quite frankly his message is getting very hard to take, but he has shown the patience of Job and he undoubtedly needs that patience. However, if we are in such dire straits, and I am afraid we may be, what is so wrong with a union government to put all leaders and all parties on the spot?
There was a fellow Nova Scotian, Sir Robert Borden, back in the days of the First World War. As a result of some problems with conscription and/or Quebec and through some political intrigue and some political manipulation he developed on the floor of this House a union government. It went to the people and got confirmed and then ruled until the war ended. Yes, there were some divisions in the country. I am saying this in a serious way, rather than Irish blarney from France about the state of the government party and the prognosis of the potential resurrection of the Prime Minister, against all the evidence. I think members should really talk to all of their constituents, not just their beleaguered party adherents. Right or wrong, the time is the same now as I saw here with Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the then Prime Minister. There is a certain time when the body politic of Canada for a variety of reasons, some right and some wrong, depending on where you stand, makes up its mind and says it is time for a change.
I am just about ready to conclude, Mr. Speaker. As I said in my earlier remarks about five minutes ago, regardless of who the Conservatives picked in 1983, it is my thought, having run ahead in the polls for a year and a half with Joe Clark under siege, that we would have won a majority election in 1984. Perhaps not with the
April 10, 1992

same majority and obviously not with the same contingent from Quebec, but we would have been able to do it because the body politic, long before Trudeau took that walk in the snow storm, had made up its mind that the then, Prime Minister Trudeau, had done his job, had done certain things and it was time he moved on.
I am just hoping that my former colleagues on the government side and the people they represent will get to them over this Easter break so that we can come out of this Parliament of paralysis, paralysis because the leadership question is very much a part of the constitutional question, let alone the economic question.
I am afraid and sad because I frankly think the present Prime Minister is one of the most engaging personalities we have had on the political scene in my lifetime. But the fundamental fact is that an engaging personality, with all the interesting quirks and quarks of that individual, is not what is needed at this time.
In conclusion, the people may go for a union government or not, and the Prime Minister may finally find out where we are in this constitutional proposal. The clock is ticking in Quebec. I thank God that the Prime Minister and the government caucus are finally coming around to the potential of a referendum because I was one who could never accept the fact that it was all right for a part of the country to have a referendum and it was not good enough for the rest of the country to decide for itself.
Whether we go as far as a union government-and that may be considered-surely the Prime Minister should consider if he should not pull a President Johnson. President Johnson, when caught in the machinations and division of the Vietnam war, did the right thing. He made a declaration and got out and they finally resolved the Vietnam war with new leadership.
I say in all sincerity, as we wind down here before Easter, that I think the Prime Minister has many serious things to consider. The one thing he should not try again on the Canadian public is Irish blarney.

Government Orders
country, the significance of this bill whose purpose is to control government expenditures. Imagine, a bill to control government spending.
The first question we must ask is this: How can a government be so obvious about its failure to do what it was elected to do in the first place: manage this country's affairs? The government's job is to redistribute wealth, manage the federal budget and administer its affairs. And what do we see today in Bill C-56? The government is proposing legislation to limit its expenditures.
It is absolutely mind-boggling. However, it is, above all, an admission of failure.
If we consider the problems we have faced during the past few years, including an unprecedented series of new taxes, I think it is clear to all Canadians that the GST was the worst thing that could happen to this country. Instead of tabling legislation to prevent spending, I would have preferred to see the government table a bill that would prevent taxation. Now, that would boost the confidence of Canadians. But instead, we have this purely cosmetic proposal.
Seriously, this is all a lot of smoke and mirrors and the government should realize we are not fooled that easily. I hope that the media and that journalists who have an interest in public affairs will at least make that clear across the country and tell people this is unprecedented.
I heard one of the government ministers tell one of my colleagues in the House that they had heard a lot of criticism but no solutions. We have asked the government repeatedly to introduce measures to deal with unemployment, like investing in municipal infrastructures such as sewers, dump sites, and so forth. It has done nothing. The only suggestion it agreed to implement was to let people use their registered retirement saving plans when purchasing a home and to reduce downpayments for such transactions.
There are other alternatives that could be considered. Today, we have a bill before the House whose purpose is to control spending, but I always thought that was a foregone conclusion. When I had the privilege to be elected to this House-and I would have hoped our party would form the government-it was obvious to me that our job was to control spending. I never imagined a government would introduce this kind of legislation, as if

April 10, 1992
Government Orders
they were kids who couldn't be trusted. It does not make sense.
In any case, we must consider the options for reducing our deficit. We must control the deficit, but you are certainly not doing the right thing, because the national debt has more than doubled. You cannot even take credit for reducing the national debt. It is now twice as high as it was before. Can you take credit for not raising taxes? Hardly. The number of taxes introduced by this government is unprecedented in our history. You lose on that score as well.
This government can expect to be retired by Canadians, which is going to happen very soon.
Mr. Speaker, to get back to what can be done, provincial governments, and especially the Government of Quebec have asked for a genuine policy on training. Look at the statistics. Incredibly, more than 300,000 jobs are not filled in Canada because people do not have the technical skills or the training, if you prefer. We need schools to provide training for certain trades and help fill these jobs. This gives you some idea of how badly we need a training policy.
Every year, and I would even say every month, technology is becoming increasingly important. Do we have a real national training program to deal with this phenomenon? We do not. They promised us one during the free trade debate, but they never delivered. Those are not opinions, but facts.
The massive need for training in this country could be met in co-operation with industry and the unions, and I think that is quite feasible.
I think that our young people, and I am referring to those between the ages of 16 and 24, and even up to 25, need some kind of national service. Let me explain. There is no military connotation. I was thinking of some kind of national training system for young people who are not going to school, who do not have a trade and who do not have a job, and who otherwise would have no future. We as a government have a moral obligation to ensure that our young people at least have a chance to earn a living, to learn a trade or go to a trade school. Considering the seriousness of the problem, however, we need truly creative solutions, such as a two or three year national service that would ensure these young
people would be able to learn a technical trade. For instance, they could go to a trade school under a program based on industry's future needs.
The unions would be involved as well, as they are in Germany. We admire the Germans and Japanese, so why not imitate some of their training programs? We can do it. So this is one of the alternatives: a national service for youth, to give them a chance and give them the confidence they need. That is what we all need. People lack self-confidence, and as a country, we are starting to lack confidence in ourselves. We need measures to show that the government has the political will to help these young people deal with the problems they are facing. That is one of the alternatives. How many times do we have to repeat that we need a training policy? That is clear, and the unions are willing to discuss it, I am sure of that. Industry is willing as well, because it stands to gain financially, and what better motivation could it have?
The second set of alternatives concerns our tax system. During the past 25 years, as our economy has evolved, more and more Canadians have realized that our tax system is neither fair nor equitable. The middle class is forced to pay more than its fair share and as I have said many times, and I say it again, they are fed up.
Twenty-five years ago, we had a royal commission, the Carter commission. A great Canadian, Kenneth Carter, assisted by a team of dedicated people, explained how a modem state should tax its people. They discussed a model that deals even-handedly with large national and multinational corporations, explained how personal income tax should be approached and made recommendations for sales tax as well. They indicated that in a modem state these components were necessary to ensure that taxes were fair and equitable. Unfortunately, the commission's recommendations were not followed up. An attempt was made to try to implement some of these, which met with tremendous opposition from the financial elite of this country, the big corporations, which did not agree with these recommendations. And believe it or not, it was the first report of a royal commission that was never published. How do you explain that? The Carter commission was quoted at Harvard University as a classic example for modem countries that wanted to know how to adapt their tax system. Even the Scandinavian countries used Kenneth Carter's report to adapt the tax system in their industrialized countries.
April 10, 1992

Until we realize that public confidence is linked to our taxation system, we will always be in a vicious circle. People must be confident if we are to progress and it is important that they be taxed fairly. If they are treated unjustly and unfairly, they will lose confidence and do everything they can to pay less and less of what they should pay to the state. Our taxation system is therefore something that must be reformed in our country.
The third point that I would like to raise, is that for many years in Canada-even before 1984 with FIRA- since 1984, foreign investment in Canadian industry has been too high. Too much foreign investment in Canadian industry creates tremendous problems, we must realize.
Foreign investment in Canadian industry is the highest of any industrialized country. Why must we be the champions in this field when we know that it creates many problems? First, when these companies have research and development to do, they do not do it in Canada, but in their home country. The statistics show that.
Second, these foreign companies make 75 per cent of their purchases in their home country, where the parent company is. Only a quarter of their purchases is made here in Canada, although the companies are established here. Third, we must say that when they take over our industry, a huge amount of dividends goes outside our country.
We should demystify the issue of foreign investment. If we look at the facts in our country, we see now that American companies have invested $68 billion in various Canadian industries, in manufacturing, services and consulting-$68 billion.
In the last 30 years, they have invested barely $6.7 billion of their own money. Is that clear, Mr. Speaker? They only invested $6.7 billion. Where does the rest of the money used to buy up these Canadian companies come from? They borrowed it from Canadian banks. That means nearly $61 billion which American companies used to buy Canadian companies comes from Canadian banks. They took your money, Mr. Speaker, my money, and the money of most Canadians from their
Government Orders
savings to buy Canadian companies. Talk about a sensible policy.
Please note that I am not saying it is all this government's fault. That is not what I am saying, but since 1984, it has speeded up this process. On the whole, we are all in some way guilty for this bad policy. We have been the victims of a myth about foreign investment.
Those are the three things that I wanted to mention today. Of course there are more, but from much reading and consulting many experts on the subject, we see that it is very important to correct these deficiencies in our economy.
Unless and until we have the political will to face the real problems, we will not be able to solve them. Mr. Speaker, not solving them will hurt all Canadians.
I would like to take a few moments to mention the free trade agreement that was signed with our southern neighbours. We know today that 69 per cent of our fellow Canadians realize that this agreement is flawed and that serious mistakes were made. The agreement fails to deal with some important matters and it should be renegotiated, that is obvious. But be careful. If they lack the political will to do it, it will be up to us in the opposition when we form the next government.
So, to summarize, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you for your patience regarding my speaking time, I would just say that it is in all Canadians' interests for the government to show the will to deal with the real problems. I mentioned three in particular: the tax system; training, the need to have a real training policy; and the need to deal seriously with foreign ownership in our country, in order to stop this haemorrhaging.
In conclusion, I know that all our fellow Canadians want to regain the prosperity that we knew in past years. To do so, however, will take a tremendous amount of political will and time is running out.
