The minister had rather hoped to be here himself for this particular debate, as he has addressed the House previously on the importance of transportation to Canada and the role it plays in our competitiveness and prosperity, and he wanted to extend that debate to this important piece of legislation.
However, he is in Vancouver today, as most members already know, for the signing of an agreement to transfer Vancouver International Airport to a local airport authority. This is a task he completed yesterday in Calgary and in Edmonton with the transfer of those two airports to local authorities.
The minister nonetheless wanted me to convey to the House his appreciation that this debate is going forward today, as it will certainly be of benefit to Canadians to have this bill move expeditiously through the parliamen-taiy process and on to implementation.
Today I am addressing the need to regulate certain transportation activities to promote the safety of people, property and the environment. As we are all aware, our standard of living depends on a sound transportation infrastucture and its ability to move all cargoes safely and efficiently.
The production of many goods we use, whether or not in themselves dangerous in their finished state, may involve the transportation of hazardous products at some time in their manufacture or production. This could include explosives, acids or pressure-liquefied gases.
Our concern, as the Department of Transport, is to ensure that such dangerous goods are transported in a manner which ensures public safety with no undue burden on industry.
In 1980 Parliament passed the first Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. Ten years of experience with that legislation prompted us to initiate consultations with industry, the provincial governments, interest groups and the general public on possible amendments to the act.
In July 1990 the present Minister of Transport, then minister of state, had 19,000 copies of a discussion paper distributed to industry organizations, provincial governments, federal departments, interest groups and the general public.
That paper contributed significantly to the development of Bill C-45, which is intended to replace the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act of 1980 with the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992.
Transport Canada has maintained an excellent partnership with the provinces in the administration of a single, national dangerous goods program which com-

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
prises federal and provincial legislation and a variety of joint activities.
The primary focus of Bill C-45 is to prevent accidents during the transportation of dangerous goods. It is a realistic bill and takes into account what should happen when, despite everyone's best efforts, accidents occur.
For certain circumstances, it requires that industry establish emergency response assistance plans and file with Transport Canada, for approval, summaries of these plans. A similar provision has been in place for the past several years and I must tell the House that I was extremely impressed when I learned of the excellent work done by Canadian industry associations.
For example, the Canadian Chemical Producers Association has established a national transportation emergency assistance plan that allows a member company to call upon another member company anywhere in Canada to provide assistance at an accident.
I am very pleased to be in a position to advise the House that this made-in-Canada approach, which ensures a very rapid, professional response, has been adopted in the United States and is finding acceptance in several European countries as well.
Bill C-45 will ensure that industry will respond effectively to transportation access. It also provides that any emergency responders such as volunteer fire departments will receive adequate information on the products involved. This happens through the established placarding, labelling, and documentation system.
In addition, Transport Canada will continue to operate the Canadian Transportation Emergency Centre, known throughout the industry as CANUTEC, which operates 24 hours a day to provide information and guidance to whatever technical depth is required by those who are responding to an emergency situation.
Bill C-45 will ensure that, when importers bring into Canada material that is regulated in Canada, they must satisfy our regulations.
Under Bill C-45 Canada's national transportation of dangerous goods program will remain in harmony with international programs such as those of the United Nations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, as well as those of the United States and other countries.
This will be done to ensure that Canadians will not be placed at a disadvantage in the international market by domestic requirements which either over-regulate or under-regulate transportation activities.
With respect to compliance, Bill C-45 maintains the severity of fines and jail terms provided under the 1980 legislation but two new elements are added.
First, it provides that an offence can be viewed as a new offence on each day it continues. This will ensure that an incentive remains for a company to correct an infraction quickly following its discovery.
Second, the bill allows court orders to be issued to persons convicted under indictment to (a) prohibit the person from engaging in some or all activities regulated by the bill for up to one year, (b) compensate for damages such as to volunteer fire departments for extended supplies, (c) to restore the environment, or (d) require the person to conduct or pay for technical research and development relating to the safe transportation of dangerous goods.
Except for the prohibition to engage in certain activities, the maximum penalty for the remaining three items is not to exceed $1 million per infraction.
I am very pleased with the excellent work and consultations which have led to these improvements to Canada's transportation of dangerous goods program.
I am sure the text merits the attention of all members of Parliament who will recognize the importance of assuring speedy passage and adoption of this bill.

As the bill's title indicates, it deals with the transportation of dangerous goods in all modes of transportation, by rail, road, sea or air.
The safe transportation of all types of dangerous goods is of great concern to many people. Canada is a vast nation with hundreds of thousands of hectares of uninhabited land. However, all transportation routes emanate from our cities and towns, and it is especially in these populated areas that extreme care must be given for the proper handling of dangerous noxious substances.
April 3, 1992

Many Canadians, especially those in southern Ontario, do not have to look back too far to recall an event which brought great concern to this important issue of the carriage of dangerous goods.
In 1979, a train derailed in Mississauga. It was carrying chlorine gas. Twenty-four cars of that train derailed at a level crossing at Mavis Road after a journal box responsible for the lubrication of axles overheated and dislodged. Two propane- filled cars exploded into a huge fireball of chlorine gas. Over 225,000 Mississauga residents were forced to leave their homes for several days. That image is burned into my mind because at that time I was a reporter for a local television station in Hamilton. I was assigned the reporting duties of going to Mississauga to cover the accident, what had happened and then the follow-up stories of the evacuation of all those hundreds of thousands of individuals from their homes.
I do not want to have this House think that I draw the following comparisons for partisan reasons. Not at all. I draw the comparison because, like the very motion before this House yesterday dealing with deregulation and safety, all things involved in transportation require, first and foremost, safety. As I stated in this House yesterday, you cannot fudge on safety. The parallels are these.
First of all, like the Diyden crash, the Mississauga train derailment was cause for a judicial inquiry, headed by Samuel Grange. Second, like the Dryden inquiry, the accident was attributed in part to safety standards or the lack thereof relating to inspection and proper maintenance of rolling stock. Like the Dryden inquiry, there were no warning signals. Fortunately though, in the case of the Mississauga train derailment, there were no serious injuries.
In 1970, there were three serious accidents in Ontario which caused much public concern and resulted in public inquiries. The first was a derailment at Cobourg, Ontario, that involved 25 cars. The second was a derailment of 14 cars caused by a plain bearing failure. The third was a collision.
In the 1979 report into the Mississauga train derailment, the commissioner had this to say about the Canadian Transportation Commission, the CTC, now the National Transportation Agency. I quote:
Government Orders
(k) The Question of Funding:
The reason for this inactivity, if such it can called, is twofold. First there is a lack of money and manpower. In this connection a submission has, I understand, gone into Treasury Board seeking provision for more salaries to expand the accident investigation, inspection, planning and standards development programs including the engaging of specially qualified officers to go into shippers and manufacturers' plants and railway yards throughout Canada to ensure compliance with Red Book regulations. I have no knowledge of the priorities and 1 do not wish to intrude upon Treasury Board decisions. But surely at the very least, the CTC should have the funds to find answers not dependent on information or advice supplied by the railways. The railways are answerable to their shareholders; the CTC is answerable to the public.
The other reason is philosophical. It was very clear from the evidence of Mr. David Jones, the former chairman, and Mr. John Gray, the present chairman of the RTC, that there is an ingrained reluctance to take any action involving expenditure or loss to the railways without a complete investigation of the amount of that expenditure or loss and an assurance that the benefit to be gained will fully compensate for that loss-I cannot understand how the Commissioner could leave to the railways the regulation of the speed and length of trains. A long, fast train is a profitable one; it is not necessarily a safe one.
Wise words, Madam Speaker. Does it sound familiar? Dollars versus safety? Guess which one has been winning with this government as of late?
Let us not forget as well that transportation is becoming increasingly intermodal and high-tech. On the roads, tractor trailer trucks sometimes have two full-length cars behind them travelling, some would say, faster than the speed limit. In the U.S., they have triple car trailers behind trucks. Trains carry freight boxes from trucks stacked too high. Cabooses have disappeared, replaced by sophisticated detection devices. All of these factors obviously increase the risk of an accident occurring. So, caution is the watchword.
However, let me go back to my comments to the safety issue. The Brotherhood of Railway Carmen in 1989 stated in a report that fewer inspectors and less stringent inspection could cause another accident involving dangerous goods. They stated in the report that since the 1979 Mississauga accident, 2,000 safety inspectors had been cut by the railways. That is no way to be thinking about safety.
Again, in 1989, this House was concerned with the issue of contaminated fuels entering this country by

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
road. Apparently there were not enough safety inspectors at our borders to deal with the inspection of the transportation of dangerous goods. Perhaps there are alternatives to resource allocation which could keep up with these incidents. Perhaps where centralization is concerned, there could also be a devolution of control. One suggestion put to me just this morning from the mayor of Mississauga, Hazel McAllion, was that safety inspection and related mandatory supervision of dangerous goods transportation could be decentralized.
She said to me on the telephone this morning: ""We have an opportunity here to ensure that there are enough inspectors and there is the enforcement of what the inspectors must do in the field. However, the government is going to have to provide all these inspectors and, of course, the related enforcement"". In her words: ""This is a huge country. We know where the rail lines are; we know where the train travels. We know where the ships are; we can board them and see all their cargo, but what of trucking? We do not know where all the trucks are all the time. There are no specifically designated routes that they always follow"". She has seen a bit of a complication here in trying to ensure that there is adequate inspection and enforcement of safety regulations on the industries, on the carriers.
She went so far as to suggest maybe we should decentralize and put the responsibility of inspection and enforcement on the local fire and police departments. I am not saying whether that is right or that is wrong or whether it is a good idea or whether it is not a good idea, but I have got an open mind to these kinds of things.
She does have a caveat, of course. Hazel says: ""If we put the whole idea of decentralizing inspection and enforcement into the hands of police departments and fire departments and special units within those units, we had better have the federal funding allocated to them in order to carry out the job"". The unfortunate part, and there are complications that you can see immediately in that how do you supervise all of these many different fire departments and police departments to ensure that the job is being done, et cetera. That one idea she came up with indicated again to me the statement she made that this country is huge. There are many modes of transportation. There is considerable transportation of these dangerous and noxious substances.
We could have the best regulations in the world. We could have volumes of material, regulations and rules that say we had better be making sure, if we are to transport these particular substances which are dangerous or noxious, they are contained in this fashion, labelled in this fashion, and transported in that fashion.
However, in order to ensure that is happening, we need the inspectors and then, if there are inconsistencies in the law, there must be enforcement. That is going to take a commitment by this government, a commitment that just yesterday in this House we demonstrated in the airline industry was not there. Why? It was because the government has one agenda, an ideology of economic restraint.
On the other hand, this government preaches at the same time that the need or priority of Transport Canada is safety and that we cannot fudge on it. Unfortunately the two collide. It was stated not only by me and my colleagues in the House yesterday. It was stated by Justice Moshansky in his report. It has been indicated by witnesses to Justice Moshansky and the inquiry that there is a philosophical difference between the two.
There are opinions which we should discuss, and I suggest that among witnesses who will appear before the legislative committee of this House to study this bill are municipal leaders like Hazel McAllion from Mississauga who has extensive knowledge in these areas. We could discuss her ideas further and set them out there.
For example, clause 6 of the bill would require emergency response plans by carriers of dangerous goods in case of an accident. Perhaps through this vehicle carriers of dangerous goods travelling along known routes and alternative routes could, in conjunction with local authorities, put into place such a plan as would be capable of dealing with a disaster should one occur.
Clause 9 of the bill gives powers to inspectors. The minister may invoke or revoke an inspector's licence. The minister may authorize and designate persons to approve emergency response plans or to issue directions or permits for inspectors.
There are many other requirements of inspectors such as obtaining a warrant for a search of a premises for noxious substances, for example, and powers of the minister to follow under this bill. The inspectors will have to comply with a great series of regulations
April 3, 1992

throughout the course of their duties both to ensure safety and respond to an accident.
A new provision would provide that where an inspector believed it was necessary to prevent an accident from happening, he or she could take appropriate measures to prevent harm to the environment, people and property. For the record, and I want to say it again, I have heard the government has consulted widely on this bill and it has support.
As gold plated as this bill is today at second reading before going to committee for full discussion, it will not mean anything to the safety of Canadians or their property or their environment if proper monetary resources are not given for all these safety inspections and the enforcement that may follow.
That is our message. I look forward to following this bill in legislative committee. We will be very attentive to all the witnesses who appear before the committee on it. We will ask the necessary questions including those questions, I hope, to the minister responsible, the Minister of Transport, to assure Canadians just how far this government will go to ensure that the funds are allocated and to ensure that safety and enforcement are truly the priority of this minister, the priority of Transport Canada and the priority of this government.

I am pleased that the government has brought forward this legislation. When the original bill was passed in this House a number of years ago, my caucus supported it but also argued that it did not go far enough. Surprise, surprise, I will make the same arguments today.
We support the changes that have been introduced: the clarification of the coverage through a new proclamation certainly giving inspectors greater authority to act in order to prevent injury or damage to people, property and the environment; the requirement that industry must put together response plans; the recall system for containers, transport packages, gas cylinders,
Government Orders
tanks, et cetera; and a wider range of penalties, in fact some innovative penalties that would require someone who is found guilty of a breach of this act actually to spend money to provide the necessary public prevention or clean-up equipment.
I want to outline some of the additional steps we believe the Government of Canada should be taking. A lot of them focus on those men and women who are the front line of defence when there is an accident involving hazardous goods.
I am talking about the emergency response personnel, fire-fighters, police and the medical teams inevitably found at the scene of an accident involving hazardous goods, whether it is road, rail or perhaps even air. They are the first ones there. They are the ones who are responsible for (a) trying to determine what they are dealing with and (b) trying to do something about it either in terms of containment or in terms of control or elimination of the problem.
Fire-fighters are very concerned about the lack of information. This act and its predecessor act require some form of placarding on the equipment. We have all seen the rectangular signs on their edge, but most of us do not know what they mean. The fire-fighters and police are required to know.
I am also told that in the cab of the vehicle or the cab of the train-it used to be the caboose of the train; we do not have those any more-is a manifest outlining the chemicals, the hazardous goods, and how to deal with them. We have seen a number of occasions where the cab has been destroyed and there is no direct access to what is contained in the vehicle that is now leaking or oozing something.
Fire-fighters are proposing a national computerized registry that would be instantly accessible by the emergency response personnel at the site of an accident. That registry would be required to contain all the information about every shipment of hazardous goods moving by whatever mode in this country.
Before shippers could place that material into a transportation vehicle, they would have to register the information with the computer bank. They would also be required to place a unique identifier that directly related

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
to the information placed in the data bank in a number of locations on the vehicle. If there were an accident involving a tank truck or a truck carrying low level or high level nuclear waste or any fuel or hazardous good, the emergency response team would quickly locate the bar code, feed it into the computer, and immediately know not only what was in that truck but would have a print-out as to the action it would have to take.
That action would delineate things like the kind of material to use to extinguish a fire. I am not sure if most people realize that water cannot be used on a lot of these things, that specialized foam materials or other chemicals are used to counter a fire when dealing with hazardous goods, particularly a chemical.
It would also warn the team about the toxicity of what it was dealing with, whether it becomes airborne and therefore whether all emergency personnel have to wear respirators, or whether there is the potential of contamination through the skin and whether or not they would have to wear protective clothing.
Right now we are sending our emergency response personnel into unknown hazardous situations. Quite frankly they do not know. The fire-fighters' association has documented evidence of case after case after case of fire-fighters who have eventually been diagnosed as having cancer that has been related back to a specific fire that they attended to.
We ask these men and women to put their lives on the line every time they leave the fire station, the police station or the hospital to attend to a hazardous goods accident. If we look at the breakdown of line of duty deaths for fire-fighters, we find that nearly 15 per cent are due to burns and asphyxiation, 44 per cent due to heart attack and stroke, 12 per cent due to apparatus failures, and falls by about 12 per cent as well.
Injuries due to exposure to hazardous materials of the non-inhalation kind, in other words contact with the skin, are about 2 per cent of the over-all injuries. To us it does not seem like a very large amount. However, we should think of the kind of long-term damage that can be done by fumes, by contact with cancerous agents in the line of work. It might not show up for a number of years but it can be very deadly. We need to do something about that. If we can put bar codes on every roll of toilet paper it will be very simple for us to have bar codes tied into a computerized system for every vehicle transporting hazardous goods in this country. It is a very simple process.
We have the technology to do it. All we need is the will. Bill C-45 gives us the tool to incorporate that kind of suggestion into the system. It is clearly a question of having the right to know and it will allow fire-fighters and other emergency response personnel to better ensure that public safety is promoted. The clear intent of the title of this bill is the promotion of public safety in the transportation of dangerous goods.
We can make those changes and I certainly will be pursuing that, as my colleagues will in committee.
The other area I would like to briefly mention is what happens to our emergency response personnel in the line of duty. A number of fire-fighters are killed every year in the line of duty. A number of fire-fighters are permanently disabled in the line of duty, and never return to work. The International Association of Fire Fighters has proposed the creation of a one-time compensation benefit paid to the survivors of those killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. I would like to quote from one of its legislative fact sheets:
Fire fighters and other public safety officers risk their lives daily in an effort to save the lives and property of their fellow citizens. When these brave men and women are killed in the line of duty, as they are with alarming frequency, their deaths are in defence of the citizens of their country, just as surely as a soldier who is struck down by an enemy.
Currently, Canada has no way to acknowledge the supreme sacrifice paid by these heroes who are killed or permanently disabled in service to their country. The only compensation available to them or their families is the benefits normally available to workers injured on the job.
One way for a grateful nation to pay its respect to these brave victims is to provide a one-time compensation benefit to the survivors of those killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty.
I know that we cannot do that within the context of Bill C-45. However I flag it as an issue that I believe the legislative committee should examine and then perhaps provide some guidance to the government.
The other area I want to deal with is infectious disease notification, and I believe we can do that by amending Bill C-45. Exposure to infectious disease is a major reason that fire-fighting is one of the world's most dangerous professions. Fire-fighters and other emergency response personnel routinely provide emergency medical treatment in unsanitary conditions on patients they know nothing about. This results in fire-fighters being
April 3, 1992

occupationally exposed to a variety of dangerous contagious diseases.
Fire-fighters who have been exposed to infectious diseases need to be informed of this fact so that they can seek medical monitoring and modify their behaviour to avoid further transmission.
To address this concern the Government of the United States recently enacted a law requiring that hospitals notify emergency response personnel about the infectious status of patients treated by emergency workers. The law prohibits involuntary testing of patients and only requires the hospital to share any such information in its possession. The program is also structured to protect the confidentiality of patients. It is a balancing act.
Those men and women who are on our front lines when it comes to emergency responses, primarily with regard to the transportation of hazardous goods but also in a broader context, should have the right to know. They should know if they have inadvertently been dealing with someone who has a contagious disease and that they may have been infected either through their pores, through breathing, or other ways.
I would like to see this legislation changed to accommodate that concern so that we can provide them with, not protection but the knowledge of the diseases to which they may have been exposed. In some ways, it is no different than the chemicals which they have been exposed to in the course of their activities.
One of the other areas I want to discuss is the role of Emergency Preparedness Canada. Nothing in this legislation provides an automatic linkage to Emergency Preparedness Canada. It used to be called the Emergency Measures Organization.
In each community it is responsible for disaster plans. Its people are the ones with the expertise. They are the ones who have done the planning to evacuate the Mississaugas, to evacuate parts of Thunder Bay. That is their role. Yet there is nothing in this bill requiring then-notification of any major shipments of hazardous goods coming through their area of jurisdiction. I think it has to be changed to include that notification.
Another area I want to just briefly discuss is the shipment of blood samples. Most communities do not have laboratories to analyze blood. Yet on a daily basis
Government Orders
blood is shipped from community to community to be tested. Most of the blood would not cause any problems if someone were exposed to it, but we do not know.
A lot of this blood, certainly in northwestern Ontario, is being shipped on Greyhound buses in unmarked containers. In the winter it is not shipped in the luggage compartment but is brought inside the bus and put on the racks.
There are no specific controls. This bill needs to address that concern. Workers handle it and passengers may be exposed to it without even knowing it is there. This creates a unique situation.
The other problem is that shippers must be totally responsible. It should not just be the responsibility of the transportation company. There have been situations reported to me in which hazardous goods have been purposefully disguised as something else and transported on a Greyhound bus.
Aerosol paint cans, which have the potential to explode, are regularly being transported on Greyhound buses. That is not Greyhound's fault. It does not and is not required to ask everybody to open their parcels. It is the shipper who has decided to take the cheap route to get product from community A to community B who is violating the spirit of the act. We need to tighten that up as well.
The bill is a good progression but we have additional work to do. Certainly I would hope that in committee we have the opportunity to call the people who I have been talking about, the front line troops who have to handle the hazardous goods after there is an accident, and not just the people from the industry who come in to clean it up with their specific plans of action.
It is the people who are there within minutes of the accident happening who need to know what they are dealing with. Let us hear from them firsthand so that we can get a sense of the changes we need to make to this legislation to make it the best possible legislation to protect the public and the public's employees.

It contained a number of ideas. If I were to express myself on this bill with that amount of time I would probably echo a lot of the comments he made.

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
Dangerous goods and the transport of dangerous goods is a concern for all Canadians, more so in some regions than others.
I would like to provide a local riding perspective. There is a chemical plant in my hometown, not more than a quarter of a mile away from my place of residence. At that place, the ICI plant, there is a very professional response team that is very well qualified. In fact, it is recognized as the assigned response team for any accidents in Atlantic Canada and even the eastern part of the province of Quebec. It has responded to a number of train derailments involving chemicals in the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick.
This is a concern. The member outlined some of the problems these response teams have when they get to that site. I certainly appreciated him mentioning the ideas of bar codes, proper clothing, and whatnot.
My question relates more specifically to the bill with the question of inspections-

As you know, Madam Speaker, the bill authorizes the designation of inspectors whose duties consist of monitoring compliance with the provisions of the act.

I know that the hon. member is quite concerned with transportation and that he participated quite extensively in the debate yesterday on air deregulation. I know that he is quite aware that we are talking about some types of deregulation in the transport industry in all modes.
I am wondering if the member could assist me and members of the House by advising us whether he feels that there is an undertaking by the government to ensure that we have enough inspectors and whether there will be proper training for those inspectors. I would also like him to comment on whether he thinks that the government would provide the money. Yesterday we heard in the debate, time and time again, people questioning whether the government had the commitment to ensure that inspectors were definitely in place.

In examining the Department of Transport estimates for the current fiscal year it was clear, at least on the rail side, that it had made a conscious decision to increase the level of funding for rail safety and I applaud that. This is not something that people normally expect me to say in this House, but when it does a good thing it should be complimented for it.
However, only time will tell whether the continuing cutbacks by the railroads themselves, as they cut comers and find ways to be more competitive with their competitors in the United States and with trucking, will mean that we will see an increase in accidents in spite of the number of inspectors.
Keep in mind that the railroads themselves have their own inspection crews to monitor the safety of the operations. This has changed from a situation in which an individual would walk the whole length of the train and then the other side to check all the important components to one in which there is a drive-by inspection in which somebody just stands and watches to see if anything is hanging down. The railroads are doing that.
The government inspectors check the inspectors. I do not believe that the system is more safe today than it was 10 years ago, in fact I would suggest the opposite.
Also with regard to the member's comments, there was an article in The Ottawa Citizen on March 16, just a couple of weeks ago, about the closing of a stretch of highway 401 west of Cornwall. It was closed for 13 hours when a cylinder of chemicals fell off a flatbed trailer truck.
The mishap late Saturday afternoon had police and fire-fighters from nearby Ingleside scrambling to prepare for possible explosions and toxic gas leaks. They believed that the 20,000 kilogram cylinder contained highly explosive liquid nitro-oxyacetylene. The Ingleside fire chief, Shaw Lalonde, said that later information revealed that the chemical was in less dangerous gel form. He said that there was mass confusion as to what was in that container and blamed the trouble on incorrect paperwork.
This is a classic example showing that we need bar codes and a national computerized registry so that we do not have this kind of confusion, chaos, and danger.

I would like to ask him another question concerning this issue. I am sure he is aware of the private members' bill introduced by the member for Mission-Coquitlam, Bill C-334, an act respecting the identification of dangerous goods and to amend the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act.
I wonder if he could clarify the need for such legislation in Canada. I know that in the province of Manitoba there have been many incidents that have scared people in Winnipeg and in rural areas in which towns have had to be evacuated because there is not adequate protection at the present.

Finally, this bill identifies nine classes of dangerous goods and regulates their transportation in terms of securing the safety of the public, property and the environment. The nine classes of dangerous goods are as follows: explosives, compressed gases, inflammable liquids, inflammable solids, oxidizing substances, toxic substances, radioactive materials, corrosives and miscellaneous dangerous goods, including environmental pollutants.

This bill attempts to deal with a variety of issues concerning the transportation of dangerous goods from one location to the next. It attempts to strengthen the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. It also attempts to provide a clearer legal framework for regulating the transportation of dangerous goods. It seeks to place additional emphasis on taking steps prior to transportation to protect the safety of people, property and environment.
The 1980 act that was in place attempted to bring in partners such as the territorial and provincial governments to set up some standards dealing with the transportation of dangerous goods.

Since the free trade agreement came into effect, U.S. customs harassment based on country of origin markings has cost our printers 1,700 jobs and $160 million in lost exports. Since the FTA was implemented, Canada's annual print deficit with the U.S. has reached $330 million. That is a 200 per cent increase since 1988.
Here is the problem in a nutshell. The country of origin marking regulations in the U.S. are far too strict and are not always applied fairly. On the other hand, Canada's regulations need to be tightened to ensure that imported products are properly marked.
Canadian commercial printers want a level playing field with the Americans. They do not have that now. The problem cannot be wished away. It requires government action now.

Members of the International Law Commission of the United Nations, distinguished diplomats, expert law professors from all over the world, including Professor Sharon Williams of Canada and Cherif Bassiouni of the United States, legal advisers and judges put forward a proposal for an international criminal court and a model international criminal code to go with it. Surely this is an idea whose time has come.
Take the current problem of the Libyan nationals accused of blowing up western airliners, including the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Clearly, there is some doubt whether the Libyans could get a fair trial in Libya and Libya is reluctant to surrender them to a U.K. or a U.S. court. The solution is a world criminal court.
Take the case of international drug dealers, genocide or criminal environmental acts like what we saw during the gulf war, cases again for such a court.
Madam Speaker, I call on the House to urge the Government of Canada to support at the United Nations Sixth Committee this fall the proposal for an international criminal court, an idea whose time has come.

There are reports in the newspapers that the commissioner for fisheries is to suggest to the ministers of fisheries of the European Community, who are meeting, that some kind of an offer be made to Canada, that they would reduce by some percentage their quota for northern cod.
Since they have no proper quota for northern cod outside 200 miles, since they are ignoring a moratorium with respect to cod that was imposed by NAFO, the international body for the area that manages fisheries matters, and they have been ignoring that since 1986, we can hardly be impressed by their suggestion that they would reduce their quota.
In addition, the facts are that on March 16 the European Community issued a report with respect to surveillance and enforcement of their own European Community waters and they frankly admitted that they are unable to enforce their own rules in their own European Community waters. If they are unable to enforce the rules on Spain and Portugal in their own community waters, what must the situation be with respect to surveillance and enforcement outside 200 miles?
Such an offer is obviously not one that we are interested in. Number one, they have no quota to offer us to reduce and number two, they have no powers of surveillance and enforcement over Spain and Portugal. This is not anything in which anyone is going to be fooled.

We are pressing in New York our resolution with respect to the rights of the coastal state to manage straddling stocks.
This week we had Premier Wells down there as a witness. We are quite willing to use anyone at all who is interested in this issue to make our point, so we are pressing this resolution before international bodies. We are continuing our diplomatic approaches in various capitals.
The Prime Minister himself will be taking this matter up with Mr. Delors, the president of the European Community on April 23 when he meets President Mitterrand and other leaders of the European Community. There is a very vigorous campaign under way in connection with this issue.
We first have to persuade the rest of the world that it would be right for us to extend fishery jurisdiction before we take that step, because at the present time the rest of the world does not recognize the rights of anyone to manage fishery resources beyond the 200-mile economic zone provided for in the Law of the Sea Convention.

In fact, we are disagreeing with the U.S. forcefully with respect to its suggested attitude to the Pacific salmon treaty. That treaty clearly states that the U.S. catch of Fraser River sockeye is to be capped at seven million between 1989 and 1992. The treaty says that the catch includes Fraser River sockeye wherever they are caught, including Fraser bound sockeye caught in Alaskan waters.
The United States wishes to make a change now. It says it does not intend to include Fraser River bound sockeye which were harvested in Alaskan waters over the past three years as part of the seven million allocation. That would obviously be a breach of this treaty and we are strenuously objecting.

All of our information is available to anyone that wants it. We have not had any disagreement from European Community scientists with respect to our information. There has been no disagreement in the last several years. So this is just an attempt to confuse the issue.

We have been working with companies that have been active in the military field to try to help them to make a transition into non-military products. The program that has been used by and large has been the Defence Industry Productivity Program which does provide for that type of funding of research projects that provide the base for employment in new fields of activity.
If my hon. friend wants to encourage this company, MuRata Erie, to come to the government with a proposal, we would certainly look upon that with great interest.

The Prime Minister has taken an active position on arms control and the importance of reducing the levels of armaments, particularly in the so-called hot spots of the world. Our international actions and activities are dedicated in that direction.
As far as internally or domestically is concerned, the Canadian military industry or the Canadian high-tech industry is much less reliant on military than many other countries. We do not have nearly the same challenge as

In Winnipeg and in virtually every other major Canadian city there are waiting lists for training programs of two years or more. These Canadians want training so that they can get jobs.

Having said that, we are always anxious to improve on any law. Because of numerous recent allegations on this matter, I have spoken to the Chief Electoral Officer as recently as yesterday.

I want to thank the member for the question.
The House in its wisdom put together a committee to review the Elections Act. All parties chose experienced members with long experience in politics and in this House. I detect a predisposition in members of all parties to do several things. One is to continue a tax credit system because it establishes a broad base of support for the political process. Instead of a few people with a lot of money controlling it, it belongs to the people. I think we are all agreed with those kinds of clauses.
We do have suggestions from the Lortie commission about a clause for change that would do a great deal of what the member is suggesting.
I would go one step further and say, not just for political parties, but if the receipt is for a tax credit at the federal level, then the money should be spent for federal purposes only. If it is provincial, it should be provincial purposes only.
In today's Quorum you will note that the Reform Party of Canada in Alberta claims it is not running any candidates but it has been registered and has been given the power to give tax receipts for provincial purposes. Maybe the provinces should look at this as well.

I started by congratulating the minister and his staff as well as the administration for their work on this piece of legislation which is, in fact, fairly similar to the act which was introduced in 1980, with quite a few exceptions and a few new proposals.
Government Orders
What really intrigues me with this bill is the fact that it addresses two partners, the provincial government and the federal government. Throughout this bill there is one partner missing, the municipal government or regional government.
When we are dealing with questions affecting the environment, this particular issue falls under the jurisdiction of three levels of government, the federal government, the provincial government and the municipal government, the community as a whole. This piece of legislation does not seem to put it in black and white that a third partner is included.
There are some very good aspects of the proposed legislation, especially when we look at the areas of safety requirements, standard marks, emergency response assistance plans and means of containment. For example, this bill would make it an offence for a person to handle, offer for transport, transport or import any dangerous goods unless the person, the goods and the means of containment satisfy the requirements of the bill.
The bill introduces a concept of a standardized means of containment. This particular term would be defined to mean a container for which safety standards have been prescribed in the regulations and which was used or intended to be used for the transportation of dangerous goods.
It goes on to say that no person would be permitted to sell, offer for sale, deliver, distribute, import or use a standardized means of containment unless it displayed all the applicable prescribed safety marks.
That is good, but it goes further to add a new provision which would require manufacturers or importers of standardized means of containment to keep records of the persons to whom they distributed their product. If it were later found that these means of containment were unsafe for handling or transporting dangerous goods, suppliers could be required to issue notices of defective construction or recall to their customers.
These are excellent proposals in the legislation. What is missing, unfortunately, is the third partner, the municipal government, as it deals with the question of transport.

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
One other aspect which I found to be intriguing is that while there are a lot of new provisions, when it comes to the area of inspection whereby we are giving the inspectors authority, rightly so, when they believe there are reasonable grounds that dangerous goods are being handled, offered for transport or transported in a way that does not comply with the bill, they could detain the goods until they were in compliance, it also gives the inspector the authority to take any measures necessary to remedy non-compliance and allow them to direct any qualified person to take them. That is good, but what is missing is the enforcement, to provide the necessary funds for inspectors in order to apply the rules as set by the legislation.
For any piece of legislation or any proposal, it does not matter whether it is introduced at the federal level, provincial level or municipal level, the key is to have the mechanism for enforcement. That brings us to the human aspect. We have to ensure that we not only have enough inspectors, but that we have the tools that are necessary so they can do their jobs properly.
What has been lacking throughout this whole discussion is the matter of the necessary funds in order to make sure that the bill is enforced and inspectors are capable of doing their jobs.
I do not know how many more inspectors the government is planning to hire. I do not know whether it has thought about that aspect of the legislation. I do not know whether the government has gone as far as trying to do some work with the different levels of government in terms of their enforcement in the difficulties they are having.
I can tell you on the question of environmental impact, the transfer or transport of dangerous goods from one location to another has been identified as a priority for the people of this country. In particular, it has been identified as a priority for the people in my riding of Ottawa Centre and throughout the province of Ontario. I say this because unfortunately quite often what we are seeing is that the transportation method, whether that is by truck or train, is passing through urban centres without making sure that certain provisions and requirements are met. When it comes to that, it is extremely important, at least at the municipal level, to be aware of what is at stake for employees in terms of the transportation of dangerous material going through that particular city, town or area.
Setting up standards is a key when it comes to the environment. If there is any need for national standards, I would say that the environmental needs are there. This should in fact serve as a notice. As we are introducing the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, perhaps the federal government should use this as a first step toward negotiation with all levels of government with a view to setting up standards when it comes to the environment.
The reason I say this is because as you go from one part of the country to the next, there are different environmental standards. For instance, what is a priority for one region when it comes to the cleaning up of the environment or taking care of dangerous goods in one area might not be treated the same way in other parts of the country or in other areas.
Environmental standards are very important, especially at this point in time. In 1988 and thereafter there has been a lot of talk about the clean up of dangerous material from major urban centres throughout Canada. I have not yet really seen any direct action taken. I have not seen the results. If there has been any work on the part of the government, any government, we have not seen any impact study to show that. In fact, if we have cleaned up our urban centres of hazardous material, we have simply moved the waste material that could be stored from one part of the country or another.
To that extent, it is high time for the federal government to start discussion with different levels of government, provincial and municipal, in order to deal with the question of stored dangerous materials, especially in major urban centres, in order to set up a strategy where this material could be moved to another location where the safety of the public as well as the safety of the environment would not be at stake.
The question of enforcement is important. Far more important than the question of enforcement is the question of prevention. As you know, our legislation at the federal level, the provincial level or the municipal level seems at all times to deal with the problem at hand. Unfortunately, we do not seem to see a lot of legislation at the different levels dealing with the question of prevention. When we talk about the question of prevention, we are talking about the questions of education,
April 3, 1992

public awareness, and outreach programs. Whether that is at the high school level, whether that is in the community, in the business sector or in different parts of society, we have to take an aggressive step and move one step further to say that from now on every single piece of legislation that is introduced to deal with every single issue has got to have as part and parcel of it a preventive measure.
That would apply to any kind of legislation, whether the legislation is dealing with the question of the environment, or whatever. It must contain that element, the issue of education and the issue of prevention.
I spoke a little bit about the absence of the third component. A little earlier today my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier brought to my attention a very important issue. Probably in the period of question and answer he will be very much interested in sharing his concerns, not only with this House but also with Canadians across the country, to give an example of what is happening in one of the ridings in the Ottawa-Carleton region.
There are a lot of good things in this legislation. What is missing, as I indicated, are the questions of enforcement, outreach, prevention and education. When I spoke about enforcement I mean the lack of funds in order to do the actual enforcement.
I understand that the government is planning after second reading to have a public hearing. This would be an excellent opportunity for all of us in government, as well as the community as a whole, to bring forward to the committee during those hearings any concerns they might have regarding the transfer of dangerous material and the transfer of waste from one point to the next.
At hand here is a piece of legislation that, in my view, is a good start, the beginning I hope of what might lead to a discussion with the different levels of government whereby eventually we would have a national environmental standard throughout Canada so that we can protect the interests of the public and deal with the question of safety in a tangible and effective way.

When the bill was
Government Orders
tabled last December, I immediately communicated with regional and municipal groups concerned to find out if the bill would have an impact on my riding. My first concern at that time was the transportation of hazardous materials.
I was concerned then with the transportation of dangerous materials in my riding because, as we know, Ottawa-Vanier is the natural corridor for trucks carrying goods that are sometimes considered dangerous. I wrote to Peter Clark, the chairman of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton on January 15. He answered me on March 4.

In his letter to me Mr. Clark brings out some very interesting facts concerning the transportation of goods in general and dangerous goods in particular. I want to share with the House some of the comments he makes in his letter dealing with Bill C-45, a bill which we know will strengthen the rules and regulations pertaining to the transportation of dangerous goods. Over a 12-hour period, that is half a day, in my riding the heavy truck traffic on the MacDonald-Cartier bridge, which is an interprovincial bridge linking Ontario and Quebec, is approximately 2,200 vehicles or trucks representing about 5 per cent of all the vehicles using the bridge during that time frame. To quote from the letter:
During the morning and evening commuter peak hours the hourly heavy truck volume is approximately 200 vehicles per hour, again representing three to five per cent-
In my own riding, the letter continues:
Truck volumes on Nicholas Street (south of Laurier) are slightly higher at 2,500 (two-way flow) between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. and represent seven to nine per cent of total traffic flows for that period. During the morning and evening peak hours, hourly volumes range from 180 to 270 vehicles per hour and again approximately seven to nine per cent of the total traffic flows.
Last year 24 per cent of all accidents in that corridor were with trucks. There are some serious preoccupations with the problem in my riding. I know the member for Ottawa Centre appreciates it because he was there. He was a member of Ottawa council. He was a member of regional council. He understands this problem. My preoccupation has mainly been with the transportation of dangerous goods.

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
In the letter I received from Mr. Clark, he said that 2.1 per cent, approximately between 45 and 50 trucks, a day transport dangerous goods. Dangerous goods, as defined in the letter from Mr. Clark could be anything from solvents to propane, oxygen, fuels, petroleum products, et cetera.
My preoccupation is with clause 3(1) of the bill which reads:
This act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a
province.
I underline ""or a province"". We are dealing with essentially an interprovincial problem between Ontario and Quebec. I guess it could happen between any province. Does the member have any suggestions as to how we can involve the regional municipalities and the municipalities in addressing the problem of transportation of dangerous goods, so that we can assure ourselves that we are not dealing with a potential risk for which municipalities will have to carry some blame and which the provinces will have to resolve in some way? The authority of the federal government would be paramount. As far as I am concerned, there would be a responsibility with inspectors to make sure that transportation is safe and that transportation is done in a co-ordinated and secure manner. Mostly the regional governments, along with the provinces, have to stop using downtown corridors to transport dangerous goods because of the inherent difficulty that exists. An accident could cause undue damage to our environment, undue damage to the quality of life of the people in that community, and possibly undue damage to our over-all well-being because of loss of life or something else.
Has the member in his experience as a member of the municipal council and as a former member of the regional council addressed this problem? Can he give me a reason or some kind of satisfaction that indeed we can look forward to federal, provincial and municipal co-operation to resolve this issue?
particular on questions of transportation and questions affecting the environment.
I must say that the best approach to solving any kind of a problem is direct consultation. All of the different partners should be brought together to look at their concerns and to try to deal with them.
My colleagues have for example set before us the question of the interprovincial transfer of goods. In the hon. member's riding of Ottawa-Vanier there is a north-south connection. I might suggest that there is a lot of truck traffic on the routes my colleague has indicated from the province of Ontario to the province of Quebec.
There is nothing in this legislation that would really address the question of urban safety as it relates to the transfer of goods. Also, there is nothing in the legislation that would deal with the transfer of hazardous material from one province to the next, who is responsible, and at what point one province will take over the responsibility of ensuring the safety of the trucks or the safety of the community.
To that extent not only do I want to commend my colleague for raising it, but also I want to assure him that it has been a concern of the municipalities in the past. As we have seen in the communication from the municipalities in this region, there is concern about the tremendous amount of traffic flow and the rise of truck traffic accidents.
I wonder what the government is planning to do in order to address those concerns, especially in light of the fact that the federal government has washed its hands of its responsibility as a full partner when it comes to infrastructure, when it comes to transportation links, when it comes to interprovincial connections, and when it comes to the question of helping out municipalities to deal with their sewage treatment plants, with the overflow of their sewer systems and so on.

Of course one could attribute an days when I was on municipal council the hon. member accident that has taken place to the lack of good roads, communicated with me on a regular basis verbally and in large enough roads or safe enough roads for trucks writing, raising the concerns of his constituents, in transporting waste material.
April 3, 1992

The question of the environment again is not and never will be the responsibility of one level of government. It must and has to become the responsibility of all the three levels of government. One component which is missing in this legislation, as I have indicated and as my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier has clearly put before us, is the third component, that is the municipal level and safety when it comes to transfers of dangerous material through urban centres.
I do not know the answer except that I think the federal government has a responsibility through the Department of Transport, as well as through other departments, to address this question with the municipalities and with the provinces as it relates to environmental standards.
That brings me to the second point which my colleague raised with me a little earlier today, that is, what are we going to do with the dangerous material presently in storage in major urban centres across Canada? What are the plans? When is the government planning to start removing these dangerous materials from major centres in Canada in order to ensure the safety of the public for today and tomorrow?
I want to thank my colleague from Ottawa-Vanier for his question.

As the House will know, this bill seeks to bring into legislation a number of important ideas and recommendations. As far as it goes, it does have my support and the support of our party, as our critic in the area has already explained.
I wish to make a couple of comments if I can arising out of an interest in the issue on the west coast of Canada. A couple of years ago public attention was drawn to the fact that dangerous goods were often transmitted on B.C. ferries and that they were being transmitted without adequate inspection, supervision or compliance with the regulations. In that context, therefore, we had a very careful look at the situation. It became very clear that it is all very well to have a good piece of legislation or to have good regulations, but it is even more important to have adequate personnel provided by the Government of Canada to ensure that the act and the regulations are complied with.
Government Orders
There is still no report back to this House about the situation on the B.C. ferries, and in particular whether the government has acted on the public concern expressed at the time to see that the regulations are complied with and the public is being protected. We will look forward to hearing at committee state from the minister and from the department on this issue and trying to get some commitment from the government that it will couple with this legislation adequate resources and adequate staff to see that the public is in fact protected and that Bill C-45 is not simply words and window dressing.
The next contribution I would like to make deals with a couple of the inadequacies of the bill, particularly because the bill fails to reflect the very effective representations that have been made to all members of Parliament by the International Association of Fire Fighters. In particular is the proposition that there should be included in federal legislation the creation of a public safety officers benefit which should be indexed and payable to the survivors of fire-fighters who are killed in the line of duty, or to the family of an officer who is permanently and totally disabled in the line of duty.
Second is the requirement that hospitals should be given a mandate to notify emergency response personnel of possible exposure to infectious diseases. Third is the need to create a computerized response information system so that fire-fighters can have access to accurate and instant information at the scene of a hazardous materials incident.
These provisions should be in the bill. The government should advise the House and the public how come it was left out. On the face of it, these very important concepts and provisions should be reflected in the bill. They are already reflected in the private member's bill of the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, and it is important these ideas get the full consideration of the House.
With those comments we will certainly support second reading so that this bill can go before the committee in the hope that at that stage we can get the necessary improvements.

I want to raise two or three items that will be of particular concern to all members,

April 3, 1992
Government Orders
to the industry and to all workers involved in the shipment of hazardous products. These items will undoubtedly arise during the course of committee consideration.
I just preface with a few general remarks on the bill. The bill before us, the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992 is a redrafted version of the current Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. The stated purpose of the bill is to promote the safety of people, property and the environment during the transportation of dangerous goods.
Among other items that the bill addresses are the handling, transporting and importing of dangerous goods, safety marks, safety requirements and safety standards, emergency response assistance plans, regulation of standardized means of containment, financial responsibility, actions during emergency response and inspection and intervention authorities of federal inspectors.
Bill C-45 would strengthen the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. We fully admit that, and we are pleased to see some progress made.
It would provide a clear legal framework for regulating the transportation of dangerous goods. It would place additional emphasis on measures which would have to be taken prior to the transportation activity itself in order to protect the safety of people, property and the environment.
In addressing the last point mentioned, I would just like to comment briefly on the matter raised under section 6 of the inspector's guide to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992.
Section 6 reads:
Some dangerous goods involved in an accident may continue to cause harm or hold the potential for harm after the initial accident has occurred. For example, a tank car containing a compressed or flammable gas may be in such a position or circumstance that there is concern about the tank itself rupturing and causing a secondary accident effect. For some special dangerous goods, as described in Schedule XII of the Regulations, emergency response assistance plans must be in place before these products are shipped. Essentially this places a burden on the consignor of a product to be prepared to respond in case there is an accident with this product.
This burden falls upon the consignor, who is often the manufacturer, as he is the person who is the expert with respect to the characteristics of the product and he is the person who should know what is required to effectively respond to such an accident. If the consignor is not in Canada, the importer is essentially viewed as
the consignor. (This principle holds throughout the Act such that anything which occurred or should have occurred outside of Canada is the responsibility of the importer. Note that this provides for better protection and enforcement than dealing with an agent. Consequently the requirements concerning agents have been deleted.)
Our major concern here is covered in the next one to two paragraphs:
The way this section will work is that when someone wishes to ship a Schedule XII substance he will submit a summary of an emergency response assistance plan and will ""immediately"" receive temporary approval. Once the plan has been examined carefully by a Remedial Measures Specialist and found to be acceptable the approval will continue. If the plan turns out to be unacceptable, approval of the plan would then be cancelled and the result would be that the shipper would have to cease shipping that dangerous good.
That particular paragraph gives us some cause for concern. It appears from this documentation that immediate temporary approval will be given to the transport of Schedule XII goods, the most hazardous products, before careful examination by a remedial measures specialist.
If the intent of this is, and it is made clear that it is simply to give preliminary approval, the actual shipment cannot take place until the careful examination, that may be well and good. It will be of little consolation to safety personnel or to communities through which hazardous products are shipped if the turnaround in the decision and the cancellation of the shipping takes place after an accident has occurred because those goods are already in shipment.
Obviously that is one of the areas that we want to look at carefully during committee consideration, to ensure that the immediate approval that is given only gives rise to prior clearance and not to shipping itself until there has been, as it is put here, a careful examination of the conditions.
There are a number of other concerns that have been mentioned briefly by my colleagues which I would also like to touch on.
In my own constituency of Kootenay West-Revels-toke we do have a large number of very hazardous goods in transit. Our area is mountainous. Whether those goods are travelling by truck or by rail, and most of them are shipped on one of those two mediums, we have some of the more difficult stretches of rail in the country and certainly many of the steepest grades in the highway system.
April 3, 1992

What we have seen partly through the policies of this federal government when it comes to transport regulations and legislation is an increasing use of our highways by heavy transport trucks, often on steep grades into urban areas. Many of them carry dangerous goods such as chlorine gas in large quantities.
Rail is a relatively safer means of transport. It is more controllable because there is no competing, generally speaking, on the roadbeds with passenger traffic which is much more unpredictable in its behaviour. The conditions of the roadways and the highways are also very often much more hazardous than is the condition that exists on rail. The abandonment of many spur lines serving industrial areas has caused this transference away from rail and on to the roads.
We have had a number of incidents. Luckily there were no major releases of substances which would cause a grave and immediate health hazard to civilian populations. But we have had a number of serious accidents involving trucks carrying industrial materials, some of them safety related, right into the communities of Trail and Castlegar.
Because we have had a bit of a propensity in times past we have also had situations where we have had not accidental explosions take place from time to time on some of the rail lines in our area. These often caused disruptions to major industrial transport by rail and by truck. That is something we hope to never see repeated. But we do have the problem taking place on the highways with increasing incidence.
One of the other matters that my colleague, the member for Kootenay East, raised yesterday in consideration of another subject is also of concern on this matter. That is the change that has taken place in the railway industry, with the elimination of cabooses to getting rid of flashing lights or strobe lights at the end of trains and their replacement by reflectors. Some of those trains transport dangerous goods.
One may wonder what this has direct relevance to in relation to this bill. If we have an increasing number of accidents-and that is almost surely going to happen as a
Government Orders
result of the relaxation of some of these regulations in transport-then the incidence of releases of hazardous materials into fast-flowing waterways in the mountains of British Columbia is surely going to occur.
If there are reflectors instead of flashing strobe lights on the ends of trains, which ends of trains are no longer manned by individuals who can give constant reports back and forth between units, then in a mountainous area where there are not only steep grades but also a great amount of cloud, fog, mud, snow and curves, there is simply no opportunity to respond. Long braking distances are required on steep grades if there is no clear sign from the end of the train that it has come to a halt or slowed down in order to apply the brakes to avoid a major collision.
Those are in areas again that where those railway carriers are carrying hazardous products and there are releases in the fast-flowing waterways, the damage is done before any emergency response team can get to it.
Those matters are relevant even though they are not directly involved in the consideration of the bill before us.
Finally, I would like to touch once more upon the matter of the submission made to a number of my colleagues, both in the New Democratic Party and I am sure in other caucuses last May by the International Association of Fire Fighters.
Their appeal links in to some degree with a study, the ""Electronic Waybill for Rail Transport of Dangerous Goods,"" which was prepared for the Transportation Development Centre, policy and co-ordination, Transport Canada by ATG, Automation Technologies Group Ltd., and submitted in August 1991.
That system primarily would provide for electronic monitoring of hazardous products and the shipment of hazardous products in a computerized system. That is vital in this day and age with large amounts of very dangerous goods being shipped so that communities, the officials responsible for the permits and the emergency response teams including fire-fighters, will know at a moment's notice just what they have to deal with and how they should deal with it.

Government Orders
A submission was made by the International Association of Fire Fighters to us last year. My colleague, the member for Mission-Coquitlam, has a private member's bill dealing with this topic and perhaps that could, because it is directly relevant to the government bill before us, be considered in some detail when we get into committee.
Just as a background the fire-fighters entitled their proposal ""Right to Know"". They point out:
The most dangerous aspect of fire fighting is responding to incidents involving hazardous materials. Fire-fighters in Canada are especially hampered by a lack of information available at such incidents. Accurate, accessible information is crucial to saving lives and property at the scene of these incidents since the appropriate response for one hazardous material could prove catastrophic if another substance is present.
A variety of technologically advanced systems are available which would enable fire-fighters to learn the exact nature of hazardous materials present at any location and provide guidance on responding to the specific incident. Such systems can be designed for both hazardous materials at stationary structures and hazardous materials in transit.
Information provided by such systems not only aids in identifying what hazardous materials are present, but also offer detailed information on appropriate emergency response techniques. Some systems can even provide guidance on evacuating specific communities.
Implementation of a hazardous materials identification system would ensure that the fire-fighters have the information they need to effectively respond to any incident enabling them to protect lives, property, and the environment.
The IAFF supports the creation of a computerized national emergency response information system which would enable firefighters to obtain accurate, instant information at the scene of a hazardous materials incident.
I would just say by way of analogy, and I am not suggesting it is quite as simple, but the same principle applies. If supermarkets can use computers to scan for price and inventory purposes, surely it is not too much to expect that that same kind of technology transmitted to a national level be used in order that fire-fighters and their emergency response crews and communities could do the same for their purposes.
That seems to me a rather minimal objective. The technology is now available. The government has some good major studies now at its disposal. There are further studies along these lines being done in the republic to
the south that we can fit in on an international basis to ensure that the very best technology is available.
We have no doubts that there is going to be some significant cost to such a system. If we consider the cost of just one major disaster, such as happened, luckily without major loss of life in the community of Mississauga a few years ago, or could happen, at any time in any major community in Canada, then the cost of implementing such a system for which technologies are now available fades into insignificance. All we need is one major incident to show us that whatever costs are involved in implementing this kind of system, it would be a bargain for all of us.
In conclusion, we generally support the thrust of the bill. We realize that it goes some way toward improving the current regime. However, we feel that there could be some improvements to ensure that lives can be saved, the environment can be saved, and communities can be saved across Canada. We will be making proposals in committee to that end.

Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur) moved,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY ACT,MEASURE TO AMEND,"that Bill C-306, an act to amend the Department of Forestry act and to make related amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to Legislative Committee D.
He said: Madam Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to lead off the debate on the private member's bill I had the privilege of tabling. As you know, the purpose of this bill is to substitute the name ""Department of Forests"" for the name ""Department of Forestry"". It would probably be helpful if I provided a brief outline of the reasons that inspired this legislation.
First of all, as you will no doubt recall, Madam Speaker, in 1989 the government agreed to include a definition of the term ""sustainable development"" in the terms of reference of the new Department of Forestry. I may point out, in all modesty, that this definition was included as a result of an amendment I tabled in the legislative committee that was examining the legislation.
In fact, the inclusion in the bill of the definition that sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs is a major step forward for the environment.
The definition gives us the assurance that the Department of Forestry will play a key role in preserving Canada's valuable forests. It also ensures that when federal governments use the term, they will have a clear and precise definition.
Second, in its report entitled Canada's Forests: The Federal Role, the Standing Committee on Forestry and Fisheries emphasized the importance of sustainable development. In its first recommendation, the committee said that the principles of sustainable development and stewardship must be the basis for public policy concerning the management of Canada's forests.
Private Members' Business
In its second recommendation, the committee urged that the new federal Department of Forestry be charged with initiating and developing a process and a structure for the design, planning and implementation of sustainable development in Canada's forests.
In its third recommendation, the committee says, and I quote: ""-in the context of its mission and to fully embrace a comprehensive vision of Canada's forest resources, the new Department of Forestry should be renamed the Federal Department of Forests (Forests Canada)"".
During the debate on this recommendation, the committee pointed out that the English designation of the new department was considerably removed from its designation in French. You will agree, Madam Speaker, that Forestry Canada has a connotation that is entirely different from ""Forets Canada"".
Still according to the committee's report, the term forestry was confusing because it did not mean the same thing to everyone. To many environmentalists, the term applies to the lumber industry, while most departmental officials and representatives of the industry feel it covers all forestry operations and the management of these operations.
For instance, one of the witnesses who appeared before the committee, Mr. Mathew Wright, vice-president of the Nova Scotia Forest Products Association, made the point that the word ""forestry"" seems to focus far more on industrial development than the word ""forests"", which has a far more general meaning and a much broader connotation.
As you can see, Madam Speaker, the change is necessary because the English and French versions are not identical; because the term forestry is confusing; and because the name of the department should reflect its mandate.

I introduced this bill for reasons related to the forestry subcommittee report tabled in the House in November 1990.
I would like to quote recommendation No. 3:
""The committee recommends that in the context of its mission and to fully embrace a comprehensive vision of
April 3, 1992

Private Members' Business
Canada's forest resources the new Department of Forestry should be renamed the Federal Department of Forests or Forest Canada"".
It goes on to say:
""It should be noted that this change would only be applicable in the English language as the new department is now called Foret Canada in the French language and Bill C-29 is entitled loi sur le ministere des forets. In fact, the English and French names of the department will be closer in meaning as a result of this recommendation. For the purposes of consistency and so as not to anticipate any future decisions-"", and the report goes on to say that it will use the name Forestry Canada for now.
The report was signed by all parties, all members of that committee. The chairman of that committee, the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury, signed it, as did the members for Cochrane-Superior, Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Bonaven-ture-fles-de-la-Madeleine, and Elgin-Norfolk. It was supported at that time by those individuals.
The second report of the Standing Committee on Forestry and Fisheries recommended that change in the context of the mission of the Department of Forestry and said that it should be renamed the Department of Forests.
The new Department of Forestry Act contains the words: ""sustainable development"". Accordingly, the name of the department to which it applies should reflect that principle. According to the second report of the standing committee on forests there exists widespread misunderstanding about the word ""forestry"" and the values which it reflects. For many people the word denotes only commercial forest exploitation, therefore it was felt that ""forests"" would be a more appropriate and accurate term.
Finally, the English and French names of the department are not consistent. In French the name ministere des Forets translates as Department of Forests. I am certain that members will agree that the English and French names of a department should convey the same meaning to avoid confusion.
Another reason I am interested in this issue is because of the sustainable development issue, which the new department is beginning to address. I tabled an amendment in committee concerning sustainable development which now forms part of the act. I am very proud of that. I am also very proud that the amendment was again supported by all parties. That shows the co-operation in the House on non-partisan issues especially.
Basically the name change is put in there because of my interest in sustainable development and because of the mission that the department now has. It is also because of the language difference between the French and English versions.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the seconder of the bill today-

I wish to thank the hon. member for Champlain for his support today.

I would also like to note the support of the minister for this bill. I would like to note the support of members from all parties. Without mentioning names and whatever, I would like to say that I have received a lot of encouragement and a lot of support and I suppose a real honourable mention to-

-to the hon. member for Champlain for his co-operation in preparing the debate today.

I believe later we will find that there could be unanimous consent to move this directly to the standing committee and we will probably make that commitment later on. The intention is to get it to committee with the idea that the bill be amended somewhat to reflect some of the discussions that we have had to make sure that the implementation is cost-effective, not to change the name overnight because that has certain cost implications and we are willing to abide by that.
I would again thank all the members and my colleagues here this afternoon for their anticipated support.

This bill was presented by my colleague, the hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur.
I am even more pleased to support this bill, because it is fully in keeping with the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Forestry published in 1990 that the hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur had in his hand. This bill, as you know, proposes to change the English name ""Forestry Canada"" to ""Forests Canada"". After discussing it at length with our caucus and the minister, we concluded that the bill was very appropriate and that we should follow it up, of course, with all the reservations that my colleague from Restigouche-Chaleur mentioned.
Changing the department's name, minor though the change is, is important. You know, Madam Speaker, that it is being done for some essential reasons. First of all, this change fits in with the department's changing role. In addition, it reflects the new emphasis that the federal government places on forest management as part of sustainable development. Finally, it expresses the growing popularity in Canada of using our forests for many purposes.
On the first point, the role of the department has changed considerably since it was created in 1960.
Originally the department concentrated on supporting the forest industry and the provinces that conducted research and implemented joint forest development programs. However, in the last few years the government has expanded the mandate of the department in order to put more emphasis on dialogue between the various forest interest groups in Canada.
We need only look at some of the recent laudable efforts made by the department and the minister to see
Private Members' Business
how Forestry Canada has succeeded in playing this valuable role.
For example, last year the minister, through the department, organized a successful parliamentary conference on Canada's forestry resources. This event brought competing interests to the same table to discuss the future of forest resources in Canada.
The government also co-operated with the provinces and industry, as well as with environmentalists, nature lovers and others, to develop the national strategy on forests.
Lately, the department has shown that, at a time when the future of our forests is hotly debated, it has done more and more to facilitate dialogue in order to find realistic solutions. The department has approached both complementary and competing groups within the government and industry and among environmental groups. We very much want to bring all those stakeholders together.
It is therefore appropriate that the department be renamed Forests Canada. The new designation will reflect the expanded perspective in which we now view the central role of the federal government in the field of forestry. Also, the name Forests Canada puts the focus of our action more clearly on the forests and therefore more accurately reflects the federal government's priorities and concerns.

The new name also makes sense as it provides the department with an opportunity to more clearly exemplify the federal approach to our forests.
We all recognize the critical importance of Canada's forests. They are one of our greatest natural resources. They are of immense importance to Canada as a nation and they are undoubtedly becoming a resource which is of ongoing interest to the world.
Canada's forests cover 10 per cent of the world's forested area. With growing concerns about the viability of the forest industry and the increasing concern about climate change and threats to bio-diversity, Canada's forest management practices are followed with keen interest, both at home and abroad.

The government, through the department, is defining its policy approach in this new, more national and indeed, more global context.

That is why the federal government participates more actively in the development and promotion of sustainable development strategies.
Madam Speaker, we know that the government has taken measures in that direction. The department, through its contribution to the green plan, will lead the way by implementing strategies based on the sustainable development of Canadian forests.
Moreover, the department strives to support Canadian participation in the development of international policies and conventions on sustainable development, including the Conference on the Environment and Development that will be held in Rio next June.
Under the name Forests Canada, the department will be able to relate the policies for the sustainable development of our forests to a national objective and, more generally, to act as a national leader in the management of our forests.
I believe the new name would put the department more in line with the new principles guiding forest management, such as multiple use and sustainable development.
Finally, the new name makes sense in that it reflects a growing movement in Canada advocating the use of our forests for a wide range of purposes, as well as the development of those forests in accordance with a whole series of values.
Madam Speaker, I want to support the new name of the department. It is a minor change. Yet, as I have tried to show, minor changes must not be neglected, because they can sometimes indicate and impel larger positive changes.
Madam Speaker, I hope that my intervention will have been useful and that we will all be able to contribute in some way to making our forests a living heritage.
In closing, Madam Speaker, I think you will find that there is unanimous consent for the following motion:
That the motion for second reading of Bill C-306, an act to amend the Department of Forestry Act and to make related amendments to other Acts, be amended so as to refer the bill to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Forestry instead of to Legislative Committee D.
