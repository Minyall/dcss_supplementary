Hello! Unlike all other modules in this course, there is no Jupyter notebook for this module. To complete the Module 1 assignment, simply go to the Quizzes section of the Learn site and answer the 5 T/F questions in the relevant quiz. These questions are completed on the honours system, however it will become very obvious very quickly if you are not honest!

Note that Module 1 is a light week, but Module 2 is heavier. If you are new to programming, I recommend getting started on Module 2 as soon as possible! If you can give yourself more time to work through it, you should. :)
