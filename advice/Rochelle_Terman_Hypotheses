# Deriving Testable Hypotheses

Linking abstract theory to testable hypotheses is one of the most important tasks for the social scientist. It is also one of the most opaque and enigmatic. We rarely teach our students how to derive falsifiable hypotheses from general theories, at least not the way we teach them how to sample from a population, interpret a T-test, or critique a colleague's paper. 

Developing testable hypotheses involves thinking through the following question: "If this theory was true, how would we know?" Here, the goal is to formulate observable implications (typically involving an independent variable, a dependent variable, and the relationship between the two) that map our theoretical argument onto empirical tests, recognizing that such tests could potentially prove us wrong. In addition, we must also consider rival explanations that are inconsistent with our own. 

When designing a new empirical project, I find it helpful to think through the following exercise. Note that each prompt can generate one or multiple hypotheses.

1.	Observable implications of my theory: "If my theory is correct, we should observe _______." 
2.	Falsifiers of rival hypotheses. "If we observe ________, then the rival theory is incorrect."
3.	Falsifiers of my own theory. "If we observe _________, then my theory is incorrect."

For example, in my paper "[Islamophobia and Media Portrayals of Muslim Women: A Computational Text Analysis of US News Coverage](https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/61/3/489/4609692?login=true)," I wanted to know how American news media reported about women abroad, particularly those living in Muslim-majority countries. For insight into this question, I drew on the theoretical literature concerning "gendered orientalism." According to the theory, American news coverage portrays Muslim societies as distinctly sexist and misogynistic, thus stigmatizing Muslims as a threat to “Western” values of freedom, tolerance, and equality. The main rival to this argument posits that American news coverage is driven less by anti-Muslim bias than by objective conditions of gender equality. If Muslim societies are cast as sexist in the American press, it is because they are the least hospitable to women. 

If the gendered orientalism argument were true, how would we know? Thinking through the exercise above:

1.	Observable implications of my theory: "If my theory is correct, we should observe _______."
  a.	News coverage of Muslim societies focuses more on women's rights and gender inequality than coverage of non-Muslim societies, all else equal.
2.	Falsifiers of rival theories: "If we observe ________, then the rival theory is incorrect."
  a.	The disparity in coverage remains even after controlling for real-world conditions concerning women's rights and gender equality. 
3.	Falsifiers of my theory. "If we observe _________, then my theory is incorrect."
  a.	American news coverage portrays Muslim and non-Muslim societies in comparable terms, or
  b.	Any differences can be statistically accounted for by controlling for objective disparities in gender equality.

Of course, nothing about this exercise is distinctive to computational work. In my study, computational methods (i.e., topic modeling) facilitated the operationalization of the dependent variable, a way to measure the substance and thematic content of news articles. In other words, computational methods only entered the picture after I had formulated my theoretical explanation and its observable implications. One thing I like to tell my students is, “if you can’t imagine executing the task by hand – even if you a million years to do it and a million research assistants helping you – then a computer will not help.” Put differently, computational methods merely augment and extend the resources available us as researchers. When it comes to theory-driven computational social science, most of the dirty work is done with paper and pencil.
